**Disclaimer:** This document is intended as a resource for clinicians
caring for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, based on available evidence
and recommendations of governing bodies. The recommendations do not
replace clinical judgment or the need for individualized patient care
plans. While we attempt to keep this document up-to-date, the literature
on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and we suggest that practitioners
search for the most up-to-date literature on any specific topic. These
guidelines will also rapidly evolve as they are implemented into
clinical practice and we receive feedback from practitioners. Finally,
these guidelines were developed based on practice patterns and
infrastructure at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA; local
factors should be taken into account if utilized at other hospitals.

================================================

Clinical Course of COVID-19 
---------------------------

a.  **Clinical presentation:** non-specific, flu-like illness

    i.  Fever (44-98%)

    ii. Cough (46-82%)

    iii. Shortness of breath (20-64%)

    iv. Upper respiratory symptoms, nasal / sinus congestion (5-25%)

    v.  GI symptoms (10%; usually before respiratory symptoms)

b.  **Transmission:**

    i.  Large droplets and fomites

        1.  Viral particles survive \< 24h on cardboard, \< 72h on
            plastic or steel ([[van Doremalen et al,]{.underline} *[New
            Engl J Med,]{.underline}*
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32182409))

    ii. Aerosols (droplet nuclei, \< 5 µm), estimated \< 4h

    iii. Incubation period: median 4 days, common range 2-7 days, up to
         24 days

    iv. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus

c.  **Disease Course**:

    i.  \~ 80% do not require critical care

    ii. \~ 10-20% develop bacterial superinfection

    iii. \~ 2-25% have respiratory viral co-infection (Qingdao, China:
         [[Xing et al, *medRxiv,*]{.underline} [2020
         preprint]{.underline}](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2);
         Stanford, CA, USA: [[Shah N, *Medium*, 2020 unpublished
         data]{.underline}](https://medium.com/@nigam/higher-co-infection-rates-in-covid19-b24965088333))

    iv. \~ 20% develop ARDS

    v.  \~ 5% develop renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy

    vi. Elevated AST / ALT (\~200s) is common; fulminant hepatitis not
        reported

    vii. Cardiomyopathy in critically ill patients; some progress to
         cardiogenic shock late in course (anecdotal reports)

d.  **Reasons for ICU admission:**

    i.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common indication for
        ICU.

        1.  Reports of rapid progression to intubation within 12-24h

    ii. Few patients with shock, can develop late in course

    iii. Median time from symptom onset to ICU transfer is \~10 days

e.  **Poor prognostic indicators:**

    i.  Demographics: Age \> 65, male

    ii. Comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (includes hypertension),
        pulmonary disease, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression

    iii. Lab findings: severe lymphopenia, elevated troponin, elevated
         creatinine, elevated LDH, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer

f.  **Cause of death:**

    i.  \~53% respiratory failure

    ii. \~33% concomitant respiratory and heart failure

    iii. \~7% cardiac or heart failure alone

    iv. Mortality rate appears to correlate with age and availability of
        medical resources ([Ruan et al,]{.underline} [*[Intensive Care
        Med,]{.underline}*
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))

Personal Protective Equipment and Infection Control
---------------------------------------------------

a.  **Personal Protective Equipment**

    i.  This is an area that is actively changing. Guidance depends on
        the specific unit, patient risk profile, and nature of contact

        1.  [[Partners PPE
            Guidance]{.underline}](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus/covid19_clinical_policies)
            (Partners sign-in required)

        2.  Please use this
            [[link]{.underline}](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/deptforms/covid-19-donations)

b.  **Isolation Protocols**

    i.  *This section is in process.*

        1.  Partners Isolation Protocol will be linked here soon
            (Partners sign-in required)

Inpatient (non-ICU) Management Principles
-----------------------------------------

a.  **COVID testing**

    i.  This is an area that is actively changing and varies widely by
        hospital, test availability, and local epidemiology

        1.  [[Partners criteria available
            here]{.underline}](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus/covid19_testing_criteria)
            (Partners sign-in required)

b.  **Diagnostic studies:**

    i.  Labs & EKG:

        1.  On admission: CBC with differential, BMP, LFTs, LDH, CRP,
            D-dimer, Troponin / CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin, baseline
            EKG

        2.  Daily: CBC with differential, BMP

            a.  For stable floor patients, consider every other day

        3.  Every other day: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin / CPK (if
            in ICU), Triglycerides (if on propofol)

        4.  If clinical worsening: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin,
            CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin, Ferritin, Fibrinogen, EKG

        5.  Expert opinion does not recommend routine pro-BNP.

    ii. Chest imaging: Portable CXR is sufficient in most cases. Avoid
        routine daily CXR (unlikely to change management, evaluate
        case-by-case).

        1.  Chest imaging variable; bilateral patchy opacities most
            common

        2.  Chest CT often will not change treatment; obtain only if
            necessary (risk of transmission, time associated with
            transport / decontamination of equipment)

        3.  Point of Care Ultrasound of the lungs can be used but by
            experienced providers only

    iii. Obtain additional studies only if necessary

         1.  Avoid routine TTEs (for cardiac studies, see: [["Cardiac
             Complications of COVID"
             chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19)).

c.  **Medical management:**

    i.  Further details in [["COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)

    ii. Management is largely supportive

    iii. Fluid management should be conservative due to risk of
         hypoxia/CHF

    iv. Antiviral and immune-modulating therapies are investigational

d.  **Early Advance Care Planning:**

    i.  In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form

    ii. Discuss and document goals of care on admission

        1.  Educate patient and family on disease course

        2.  Focus on desired quality of life and tolerance for ICU
            measures

            a.  Avoid implying availability of ICU measures if unknown
                (refer to local ethics guidance)

e.  **Avoid increasing risk of transmission:** Generally avoid transport
    if possible.

    i.  Further details in [["COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)

    ii. Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV: BiPAP, CPAP),
        High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), Humidified Venturi Face Masks,
        Nebulizers increase aerosolization.

        1.  [Any aerosol-generating intervention must be performed under
            Strict (Airborne) Isolation Precautions, in a negative
            pressure room.]{.underline}

        2.  In current policy, patients with [severe OSA]{.underline}
            may continue nocturnal CPAP / BiPAP but [must use a
            BWH]{.underline} NIPPV [mask]{.underline} and
            [machine]{.underline}, not their home mask or nasal pillows
            which have elevated aerosol risk. BWH machines have dual
            limb (with HEPA filter); in contrast, home machines have a
            single limb so they have an anti-asphyxiation (pop-off)
            valve that increases aerosol risk.

            a.  Transition back to home machine if COVID-19 ruled out

        3.  Use metered dose inhalers instead of nebulizers.

            a.  Transition back to nebs if COVID-19 ruled out

        4.  If patient already on BiPAP / CPAP / HFNC becomes
            COVID-suspected, transition to non-rebreather followed by
            intubation.

        5.  NIPPV\* is not used for ARDS; early intubation is preferred.

> \*Can be considered on a case-by-case basis for highly reversible
> indications (*e.g.*, flash pulmonary edema with rapid resolution).

6.  Similar to many U.S. medical centers, our current default is to
    avoid HFNC in DNI patients and to use NRB, although exceptions can
    be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Triage to ICU
-------------

a.  **Consult the ICU triage team EARLY for:**

    i.  Provider concern

    ii. Respiratory distress

        1.  Need O2 \> 6 LPM to maintain SpO2 \> 92 or PaO2 \> 65.

        2.  Rapid escalation of oxygen requirement.

        3.  Significant work of breathing.

    iii. Hemodynamic instability after initial conservative fluid
         resuscitation

         1.  SBP \< 90, Mean arterial pressure \< 65, or Heart
             rate \> 120.

    iv. Acidosis

        1.  ABG with pH \< 7.3 or PCO2 \> 50 or above patient's
            baseline.

        2.  Lactate \> 2.

    v.  Need for intensive nursing care or frequent laboratory draws
        requiring arterial line.

    vi. Severe comorbid illness / high risk for deterioration.

Transfer Process
----------------

a.  **Additional details in Strict Isolation Procedures Manual.**

b.  **Floor / ED to ICU:**

    i.  ICU RN brings ICU bed to the floor for transfer (to avoid bed
        transfer in COVID precautions room and subsequent bed cleaning).

    ii. Patient wears surgical mask, with an extra clean gown and sheet
        on top.

    iii. Providers wear standard PPE during transport.

    iv. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route,
        walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear
        PPE

    v.  Necessary tests (*e.g.* CT), should be obtained during transfer
        if possible.

c.  **ICU to floor:**

    i.  RN wears standard PPE

    ii. Patient travels in wheelchair or stretcher

    iii. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route,
         walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to
         wear PPE

d.  **Floor to discharge: see separate documentation of discharge
    criteria/planning**

    i.  RN wears standard PPE

    ii. Patient travels in wheelchair

    iii. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route,
         walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required to
         wear PPE

    iv. Patient is escorted directly into vehicle; contact care
        management if patient does not have access to a personal vehicle

Chapter 2: Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients
====================================================

Respiratory Failure and ARDS 
----------------------------

a.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  Histology shows bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular
        fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, pulmonary
        edema, and hyaline membrane formation ([[Xu et al, *Lancet
        Respir Med*,]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085846))

    ii. Some evidence of direct viral injury to lung tissue, rather than
        purely hyperinflammatory process ([[Xu et al,]{.underline}
        *[Lancet Respir Med,]{.underline}*
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085846))

b.  **Time course:**

    i.  Anecdotal reports that progression of hypoxemic respiratory
        failure occurs rapidly (within \~12-24 hours)

    ii. From onset of symptoms, median time to:

        1.  Development of ARDS: 8-12 days ([[Wang et al, *JAMA*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);
            [[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076);
            [[Huang et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264))

        2.  Mechanical ventilation: 10.5-14.5 days ([[Huang et al,
            *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264);
            [[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076))

Management of Hypoxemia
-----------------------

a.  **Supplemental Oxygen:**

    i.  Humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1 to 8 LPM for target SpO2 92-96%

    ii. If a patient requires \> 8 LPM NC, initiate dry Venturi mask
        (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk)

        1.  Start Venturi mask at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%

        2.  Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not exceeding FiO2
            35%)

        3.  If FiO2 \> 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM

    iii. Notify ICU triage pager

b.  **Avoid high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive
    pressure ventilation (NIPPV; i.e. CPAP/BiPAP) for ARDS.**

    i.  If a patient already on HFNC or NIPPV becomes a COVID-19 PUI,
        transition to non-rebreather if safe.

        1.  Recommend that the patient be off an aerosol generating
            device like HFNC or NIPPV for 45 minutes prior to intubation
            if clinically feasible.

    ii. Patients on home nocturnal NIPPV for severe sleep apnea may
        continue their nocturnal NIPPV. However, patient must use BWH
        NIPPV [mask]{.underline} and [machine]{.underline} (not home
        mask/nasal pillow or machine due to increased aerosol risk with
        home pillows/mask/machine) under strict airborne precautions -
        this includes a negative pressure room.

        1.  If a negative pressure room is not available, avoid home
            NIPPV and use nocturnal oxygen instead whenever possible.

    iii. If a patient is DNR/DNI or otherwise is not eligible for
         intubation:

         1.  **Current policy advises avoiding HFNC or NIPPV in DNI/DNR
             patients. However, neither HFNC nor NIPPV is prohibited and
             case-by-case exceptions could apply.**

         2.  This is an evolving area without definitive evidence or
             uniform policy that underwent multi-disciplinary
             discussion.

         3.  Considerations include:

-   Safety of staff (particularly respiratory therapy and nursing);

-   Paucity of data on the increased aerosol risk;

-   [[WHO interim guidance (published March
    13, 2020)]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)
    on COVID-19 are more liberal about the usage of HFNC and NIPPV,
    stating that systems with "good interface fitting \[i.e., good seal,
    no air leak\] do not create widespread dispersion of exhaled air and
    therefore should be associated with low risk of airborne
    transmission."

-   Difficulty in assessing how many patients failing NRB would survive
    on HFNC.

-   Pro-active treatment of air hunger through other means.

-   HFNC has been utilized in lieu of ventilation of both full code and
    DNI/DNR patients in the setting of limited resources.

> *If HFNC or NIPPV used*

a.  For HFNC, recommend patient wear surgical mask and limit flow rate
    to \< 30 L/min

b.  For BiPAP, use an in-line viral filter.

c.  Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is minimal air leak (as
    leaks propel potentially infected air significant distances - see
    "Rationale" below)

d.  Keep patient in a negative pressure room

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  *Rationale*: General consensus suggests that HFNC and NIPPV increase
    the risk of viral transmission. Given the rapid progression of
    disease, we do not expect many patients can be salvaged/avoid
    intubation using HFNC/NIPPV, but this is unknown

    1.  A systematic review on SARS found that NIPPV was associated with
        increased risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers (n=2
        studies), but HFNC was not (n=1) ([[Tran et al, *PLoS One*,
        2012]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563403))

    2.  Other studies with very limited power exist, such as a post-hoc
        analysis that found no secondary infections in medical staff
        from patients with influenza H1N1 treated with HFNC but was
        limited to only n=20 ([Rello]{.underline} [[et al,]{.underline}
        *[J Crit Care,]{.underline}*
        [2012]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762937));

    3.  Exhaled air distances are minimally increased with CPAP
        pressures up to 20 cm H2O and HFNC up to 60 LPM;
        device/interface leaks cause significant lateral air travel
        ([[Hui et al, *Eur Respir J,*]{.underline}
        [2019]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705129))

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  **Early intubation:**

    i.  We recommend early consultation with anesthesia for possible
        intubation in the setting of rapidly progressive hypoxia.

        1.  Case reports from China suggest high failure rates for
            non-invasive ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen
            ([Zuo et al,]{.underline} [[*Chin Med Sci J*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102726))

    ii. For patients maintained on Venturi mask, once FiO2 = 60% and
        SpO2 \< 92%, call for intubation if patient is a candidate for
        mechanical ventilation

        1.  There is a COVID Airway Code Team with specific protocols
            for avoiding aerosolization.

        2.  Many centers suggest Rapid Sequence Intubation when fully
            paralyzed, without ambu-bag (which generates aerosols) and
            highly experienced operators (*e.g.*, anesthesia attending).

    iii. Consider additional indications for intubation (tachypnea, work
         of breathing).

Intubation
----------

a.  *This section is in process*

Initial Mechanical Ventilation
------------------------------

a.  **Intubations outside of ICU:**

    i.  Should be attended by the Resource RT, who can facilitate early
        and appropriate ventilator settings with non-intensivists.

    ii. Use "Mechanical Ventilation with Sedation" orderset.

b.  **Initiate Volume Control (AC/VC) mode**

c.  **Initial tidal volume (Vt):**

    i.  Vt = 6 ml/kg (based on ideal body weight \[IBW\] from ARDSnet
        table, see table below)

        1.  IBW men (kg) = 50 + 2.3 (height in inches -- 60)

        2.  IBW women (kg) = 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches -- 60)

![](.//media/image2.png){width="5.5575218722659665in"
height="3.9335400262467193in"}

d.  **Initial respiratory rate 16-24, higher if acidosis present.**

e.  **Initial PEEP based on BMI:**

    i.  BMI \< 35: PEEP 10

    ii. BMI 35 to 50: PEEP 12

    iii. BMI \> 50: PEEP 15

f.  **Initial FiO2:**

    i.  100% on intubation then rapidly wean to SpO2 92-96% ([Barrot et
        al,]{.underline} [[*N Engl J Med*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661))

g.  **Obtain STAT portable CXR to confirm endotracheal tube location:**

    i.  Order and page radiology at time of intubation

    ii. Prioritize CXR and vent titration over procedures (such as
        central venous catheter placement) if possible.

h.  **Within 30 minutes of intubation, obtain an ABG (preferred) or a
    VBG and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed**

PEEP and Mechanics
------------------

a.  **If patients supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator (most common),
    perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation:**

    i.  Determine best PEEP following intubation while paralyzed using
        Pressure-Volume (PV) tool

        1.  This is a departure from use of Best PEEP Trials. PV tool is
            the preferred method due to widespread familiarity with RT
            staff, institutional experience, time constraints, and
            minimizing provider exposure

    ii. Recommend maintaining this PEEP for initial care unless
        titration is required based on clinical parameters (*e.g.*,
        hypoxia, elevated Ppl, etc)

    iii. If PEEP titration is required based on change in clinical
         status, recommend using PV tool to assess new PEEP. If this is
         not possible (no knowledgeable user available or patient
         inadequately sedated) then recommend PEEP titration by the
         Lower PEEP ARDSnet table (see below)

b.  **If patients *[not]{.underline}* supported by Hamilton G5
    Ventilator, perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation**:

    i.  Initiate PEEP based on BMI

    ii. If there are changes in clinical parameters (*e.g.,* hypoxia),
        titrate PEEP according to ARDSnet Lower PEEP table (below).

    iii. Current recommendations are to use ARDSnet Lower PEEP table.
         This table is selected primarily to avoid doing initial harm to
         patients with poor lung compliance and was chosen following
         joint MGH and BWH
         discussion.![](.//media/image3.png){width="5.161458880139983in"
         height="1.314711286089239in"}

c.  **After best PEEP determined, obtain** **respiratory mechanics**:

    i.  Plateau pressure (with goal \< 30, management below)

    ii. Static compliance

d.  **Obtain arterial blood gas:**

    i.  Goal pH 7.25 to 7.45

    ii. Calculate P/F ratio from initial post-intubation ABG

e.  **Routine esophageal balloon use is not recommended**

Targeting Sedation for Ventilator Synchrony
-------------------------------------------

a.  **Initially target RASS -2 to -3 (see table below):**

    i.  Maintain deep sedation immediately post-intubation while
        paralyzed (assume 60 minutes for Rocuronium, 10 minutes for
        succinylcholine)

        1.  [Preferred initial sedation regimen]{.underline}:

            a.  Fentanyl/Hydromorphone (boluses +/- infusion) +
                Propofol: target analgosedation and optimize analgesia
                first while decreasing sedative requirements

            b.  Measure triglycerides and lipase every third day on
                propofol or earlier if other reasons for
                hypertriglyceridemia

        2.  [Adjunct agent:]{.underline} Midazolam

        3.  [Use dexmedetomidine only when nearing
            extubation]{.underline}

b.  **Target ventilator synchrony:** Ventilator-induced lung injury
    (VILI) is common in patients who are not synchronous with the
    ventilator and can cause significant lasting damage

    i.  Once at target RASS after paralytics have worn off, assess
        patient synchrony with the ventilator (*e.g.*, signs of
        breath-stacking, double triggering, other ventilator alarms).

        1.  Titrate sedatives/analgesics to ventilator synchrony
            allowing for deeper RASS.

        2.  If patient remains dyssynchronous despite deep sedation
            (RASS -5), initiate continuous paralytics (ensure BIS 40 to
            60 prior to initiating and during paralysis).

General Management of Ventilated ARDS Patients
----------------------------------------------

a.  **Consider whether patient requires daily CXR:**

    i.  CXR clearly indicated for:

        1.  Clinical change

        2.  Concern for displaced ET tube:

            a.  Sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure or
                resistance

            b.  Decreased, unilateral breath sounds (usually on the
                right)

            c.  RN or RT concern for change in depth of ET tube at teeth

b.  **COVID-19 ICU Bundle:**

    i.  Ventilated patients should all have a daily ICU "Bundle" of best
        practices. See [[Addendum
        1]{.underline}](#addendum-covid-icu-bundle-checklist) for a
        proposed "COVID-19 ICU Bundle".

c.  **Ventilator consults:**

    i.  If you need additional assistance managing ventilator choices,
        you can request a pulmonary phone/in-person consult (pager
        11957).

Managing Ventilation
--------------------

a.  **Follow ARDSnet ventilation where possible:**

    i.  Tidal volumes should be 4-6 cc/kg using IBW (see table above) to
        minimize volumes (and thus ventilator injury).

b.  **Minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume) typically
    drives pH and PCO2:**

    i.  Titrate ventilatory parameters to pH, not PCO2.

    ii. To achieve low tidal volumes, we tolerate hypercapnia
        (functionally no limitation unless clinical sequelae) and
        acidemia (pH \> 7.2).

    iii. Because tidal volumes are low, the respiratory rate often has
         to be high to accommodate; typical RR is 20-35 breaths/minute.

c.  **pH goal is normally 7.25-7.45:**

    i.  If pH \> 7.45, decrease respiratory rate

    ii. If pH 7.15-7.30, then increase respiratory rate until pH \>
        7.30, or PaCO2 \< 25 (maximum RR= 35 breaths/minute)

    iii. If pH \< 7.15, then increase respiratory rate to 35
         breaths/minute

    iv. If pH still \< 7.15, then perform the following:

        1.  Tidal volume may be increased by 1 mL/kg until pH \> 7.15
            (until plateau pressure reaches 30 cm H2O or tidal volume
            reaches 8 cc/kg)

        2.  Deep sedation advancing to RASS -5 if needed

        3.  If no improvement, initiate continuous paralysis

        4.  If still no improvement, initiate prone ventilation (may
            improve V/Q matching and better ventilation)

Managing Oxygenation
--------------------

a.  **Minimizing oxygen toxicity:**

    i.  PEEP and Fi02 drive oxygenation

    ii. The goal is to deliver a partial pressure of oxygen to perfuse
        tissues (PaO2 \> 75, Sp02 \>92%) while limiting lung injury from
        high distending pressures (Ppl \< 30) and hyperoxia (**FiO2 \<
        75**, SpO2 \< 96%).

    iii. Lower limit goals for PaO2 / SpO2 are widely debated (and
         discussed in *Rationale*); PaO2 \> 55 and SpO2 \>88% are also
         commonly used at BWH.

b.  **PEEP management:**

    i.  Initial PEEP should be set as explained in section 4 above.

    ii. If patient is hypoxic on Vt = 6 ml/kg and ideal PEEP from PV
        tool (or PEEP determination from ARDSnet table for non-Hamilton
        G5 ventilators), perform the following:

        1.  Deep sedation, advancing to RASS -5 if needed; if no
            improvement then:

        2.  Initiate continuous paralysis (cisatracurium bolus 0.2mg/kg
            followed by infusion at 0-5 mcg/kg/min titrated to
            patient-ventilator synchrony); if no improvement then:

        3.  Initiate prone ventilation (see below); high consideration
            for use early in severe ARDS (\<36 hours from ARDS onset,
            start discussion of proning when P:F \< 150, prone within 12
            hours of FiO2 \> 75%)

c.  **Checking plateau pressure:**

    i.  Check plateau pressure with every change in tidal volume, PEEP,
        or clinical deterioration (worsening oxygenation) but not as
        part of routine practice

        1.  If plateau pressure is \> 30 cm H20, then decrease tidal
            volume by 1 ml/kg (minimum 4 mL/kg)

        2.  If plateau pressure is \< 25 H20 and tidal volume \< 6
            mL/kg, then increase tidal volume by 1 mL/kg until plateau
            pressure is \> 25 cm H2O or tidal volume = 6 mL/kg

        3.  If plateau pressure is \< 30 cm H20 and patient is breath
            stacking or dyssynchronous, then increase tidal volume in
            mL/kg increments to 7 mL/kg or 8 mL/kg so long as plateau
            pressure is \< 30 cm H20

d.  **Adjusting Fi02:**

    i.  Adjust Fi02 after optimizing PEEP

    ii. Goal FiO2 \< 75%; if FiO2 \> 75%; patient requires ventilator
        optimization. If you need assistance, pulmonary consultation is
        available (pager 11957)

    iii. It is reasonable to put a desaturating patient temporarily on
         100% Fi02, but remember to wean oxygen as rapidly as possible

e.  ***Rationale***:

    i.  *Avoiding hyperoxia:* Extensive mammalian animal data
        demonstrates that hyperoxic injury occurs at an FiO2 ≥ 75% (at
        sea level) with the rate of injury increasing as FiO2 exceeds
        that threshold. In multiple mammalian models, an FiO2 of 100%
        for 48 to 72 hours is associated with nearly 100% mortality
        rate. In lung injury models, the time to death is markedly
        attenuated. In an effort to reduce the potential for hyperoxic
        injury, the threshold of FiO2 ≥ 75% triggers progressive
        intervention throughout this protocol: increased sedation,
        paralysis, proning and ECMO consultation. For a review of
        hyperoxic acute lung injury, see [[Kallet and Matthay, *Respir
        Care*,
        2013]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271823).

    ii. *Setting the lower oxygen limits:* There is debate on the proper
        PaO2 goal, and our rationale relies on evidence for lack of
        benefit from conservative PaO2 goals in clinical trials (*i.e.*,
        PaO2 \> 55) and past association between lower PaO2 and
        cognitive impairment, although the evidence is certainly not
        definitive (mean PaO2 71 \[IQR 67-80\] for cognitively impaired
        survivors versus mean PaO2 86 \[IQR, 70-98\] in non-impaired
        survivors of ARDS ([[Mikkelsen et al, *Am J Respir Crit Care
        Med*,]{.underline}
        [2012]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492988)).
        In the LOCO~2~ multi-center, randomized clinical trial, patients
        with ARDS were randomized to their PaO2 55-70, SpO2 88-92%; or
        PaO2 90-105, SpO2 \>95%); the trial was stopped after enrollment
        of 205 patients due to futility and safety concerns (44%
        mortality in conservative oxygen group versus 30%;
        ([[B]{.underline}]()[[arrot et al, *New Eng J Med*,]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661)).

Proning and Pulmonary Vasodilators
----------------------------------

a.  **Prone early:**

    i.  We recommend early proning in severe ARDS without vasodilator
        trial (a departure from our typical practice for ARDS not due to
        COVID-19): \< 36 hours from ARDS onset, start discussion of
        prone when P:F \< 150, prone within 12 hours of FiO2 \> 75%
        ([Guérin et al,]{.underline} [[*N Engl J Med*,]{.underline}
        [2013]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23688302)).

b.  **Eligibility criteria for proning:**

    i.  Eligibility may vary depending on resources and staffing.
        Currently we recommend:

        1.  Age \< 75

        2.  No high grade shock (either single agent norepinephrine 20
            mcg/min or norepinephrine \< 15 mcg/min and vasopressin)

        3.  Not on CRRT or at risk of impending renal failure (due to
            difficulties in maintaining dialysis access while proned)

        4.  The only absolute contraindications to proned ventilation
            are spinal cord injury and open chest; BMI and patient size
            are not contraindications

c.  **To initiate prone ventilation outside of MICU and 11C:**

    i.  Discuss with the PCCM Consultation team assigned to that unit

    ii. ICU charge nurse to contact MICU charge nurse for nursing
        assistance

d.  **Managing a proned patient:**

    i.  Proning protocol is available at the MICU sharepoint

    ii. Maintain deep sedation with target RASS -4 to -5 while proned.

    iii. 1 hour post-initiation of prone ventilation:

         1.  Adjust oxygen parameters: re-assess lung mechanics (plateau
             pressure and P-V tool to determine optimal PEEP) and adjust
             PEEP and titrate FiO2 as in [["Managing Ventilation"
             section]{.underline}](#managing-ventilation) of this
             chapter.

         2.  Assess tidal volume and adjust ventilation parameters as in
             section 6

             a.  If Vt \< 6 ml/kg, may increase to maximum limit of 8
                 ml/kg while Ppl \< 30 (preferred maximum is 6 ml/kg)

    iv. If patient demonstrates improvement on proning then recommend:

        1.  Discontinuing of continuous neuromuscular blockade and
            re-assess ventilator dyssynchrony; re-institute if
            dyssynchronous

        2.  Return to supine ventilation when following criteria are
            met:

            a.  Ppl \< 25

            b.  FiO2 \< 50%

            c.  pH \> 7.3

            d.  P:F \> 200

    v.  Repositioning and skin care while proned:

        1.  Currently we recommend continuing proning as per the MICU
            proning protocol. This may change in the future depending on
            availability of PPE and staffing.

e.  **Escalation if still hypoxic:**

    i.  If hypoxia (PaO2 \< 55 with FiO2 \> 75%) persists after proning;
        then initiate continuous inhaled epoprostenol (see [["COVID-19
        Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)).

    ii. If FiO2 \> 75% despite above, recommend consultation with ECMO
        team (see [["ECMO consultation"
        section]{.underline}](#ecmo-consultation) of this chapter).

ECMO consultation
-----------------

a.  **Refractory Hypoxemia:**

    i.  If despite PEEP optimization, paralysis, prone ventilation,
        optimizing volume status, pulmonary vasodilators (when
        available) the patient meets the following criteria, then
        consider ECMO consult (pager 35010):

        a.  Ppl \> 30

        b.  FiO2 \> 75%

        c.  P:F \< 80

b.  **Candidacy:**

    i.  Final ECMO guidelines for COVID-19 patients remain under
        development. Examples of common considerations include:

        1.  Patient age \< 65

        2.  Mechanical ventilation duration \< 7 days

        3.  BMI \< 35 and patient body weight \< 150 kg

        4.  CrCl \> 30

        5.  No multiorgan failure or high grade shock (can be on single
            pressor; norepinephrine \< 15 mcg/min)

        6.  No active solid or liquid malignancy

        7.  Absolute neutrophil count \> 500

        8.  Platelets \> 50,000

        9.  Able to tolerate anticoagulation on initiation (no active
            hemorrhage)

        10. No evidence of irreversible neurological injury

        11. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

Clinical trials 
---------------

a.  **Consult Infectious Disease for:**

    i.  Patients with +COVID-19 PCR; and clinical history and any chest
        imaging suspicious for COVID-19.

    ii. Re-consult if the patient develops ARDS (mechanically ventilated
        with P/F ratio \< 300) or shock/cytokine syndrome.

b.  **Current trials:**

    i.  ID teams are enrolling for clinical trials of Remdesivir and
        possibly other antiviral agents.

    ii. ID and the PETAL network are coordinating to enroll for clinical
        trials of host-response modifying therapies (see [["Systemic
        Corticosteroids"]{.underline}](#systemic-corticosteroids) and
        [["Anti-IL6
        agents"]{.underline}](#anti-il6-agents-tocilizumab-siltuximab)
        sections of this chapter).

c.  **Monitor for drug-drug interactions:**

    i.  Patients may arrive at the ICU already enrolled in a COVID-19
        clinical trial. Verify that ICU treatment regimen does not add
        harmful drug interactions with study agents.

Antibiotic Selection
--------------------

a.  **Empiric antibiotic choice:**

    i.  Antibiotics should reflect IDSA guidelines, presumed source, and
        MDRO risk. For a presumed pulmonary source:

        1.  Without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. living in
            community, no prior MDROs):

            a.  Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin

        2.  With risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. chronic
            hospitalization, prior MDR infections):

            a.  Vancomycin + Cefepime, and consider Ciprofloxacin if
                high concern for Pseudomonas

        3.  See special dispensations for oncology patients in
            [["Considerations for Oncology Patients"
            section]{.underline}](#_aayfijcxre19) within [["Other
            Guidance"
            chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-9-neurologic-manifestations).

b.  **Formulation:**

    i.  Give oral antibiotics (Azithromycin, Levofloxacin,
        Ciprofloxacin) when possible to reduce volume load, unless
        concerns for poor oral absorption

c.  **Coinfection:**

    i.  If concurrent influenza give Oseltamivir

    ii. Given lymphopenia consider Pneumocystis and treat accordingly

d.  **Discontinuation:**

    i.  Antibiotics should be discontinued as soon as possible (within
        48h) if:

        1.  Clinical status is not deteriorating, cultures do not reveal
            pathogens at 48h, and procalcitonin and WBC are relatively
            stable from 0 to 48h

            a.  Clinical judgement should prevail over any specific lab
                value

e.  ***Rationale*:** Clinical reports indicate that rates of bacterial
    superinfection of COVID19 are low (10-20%), but when present
    increase mortality risk. Anecdotal reports suggest less MRSA
    superinfection than with influenza. Unnecessary antibiotics carry
    risks of fluid overload and drug-resistance, as well as the
    possibility that antibiotics may become a limited resource. ([[Zhou
    et al, *Lancet*,]{.underline}
    [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076);
    [[Yang et al, *Lancet Respir Med*,

    2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected))

Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs) vs. Nebulizers
-------------------------------------------

a.  **Non-intubated patients:**

    i.  For COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI, use MDI (inhalers), not
        nebulizers, due to the increased aerosol risk associated with
        nebulization.

    ii. Because MDI supply is limited, only prescribe when needed.

    iii. For non-COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI patient, use nebulizers even
         if on droplet precautions (*e.g.,* influenza) because MDI
         supply is limited.

    iv. After a patient is COVID-neg (and no longer on COVID precautions
        per infection control): After the patient's current MDI runs
        out, switch to neb.

b.  **Intubated patients:**

    i.  At BWH, an in-line nebulizer container is part of a closed
        ventilator circuit, so nebulizers can be used without opening
        the circuit and increasing aerosol risk.

    ii. Other hospitals may need to add this set-up or add other options
        such as a Heat-Moisture-Exchanger that allows MDI delivery into
        a closed circuit.

c.  **Rationale:** Nebulization may aerosolize viral particles and
    contribute to disease transmission. COVID-19 clinical reports do not
    indicate wheeze as a common symptom, and not all patients require
    bronchodilators ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,]{.underline}
    [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076);
    [[Yang et al, *Lancet Respir Med*,]{.underline}
    [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632);

    [[WHO, *COVID-19 Interim guidance*, March
    2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected))

Airway Clearance 
----------------

a.  **Management principles:**

    i.  Reports from Wuhan and Italy indicate that some patients develop
        very thick secretions causing dangerous mucus plugging. However,
        nebulizers and airway clearance techniques may aerosolize
        secretions.

    ii. Airway clearance should be used only in **selected ventilated
        patients (closed circuit)** with extremely thick secretions to
        avoid mucus plugging that would require bronchoscopy.

b.  **For thinning secretions:**

    i.  Nebulized treatment options **in ventilated patients only, on
        strict airborne precautions in negative pressure room:**

        1.  Nebulized hypertonic (3-7%) saline once daily

            a.  Side effects can include bronchoconstriction

                i.  Start with 3% to assess response and
                    bronchoconstriction

                ii. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg just prior to
                    delivery

        2.  Alternatives include Dornase alfa 2.5mg nebulizer once daily

            a.  Can cause bronchoconstriction and mucosal bleeding

            b.  Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg, just prior to delivery

            c.  Avoid in setting of bloody secretions

            d.  Anecdotal reports of efficacy in COVID-19, however data
                for management of non-CF patients are poor. In addition,
                Dornase is relatively costly.

        3.  Avoid N-acetylcysteine due to frequent dosing requirements

c.  **Airway clearance:**

    i.  Avoid oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (Aerobika
        or Acapella) and cough assist (MIE).

    ii. Continue chest PT vests if patient uses at home (*e.g.,* CF
        patients) with appropriate isolation precautions. Bronchiectasis
        patients may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators
------------------------------

a.  **Indications for use:**

    i.  Inhaled vasodilators should not be routinely used except in two
        circumstances

        1.  As a rescue strategy in already prone ventilated patients
            (see [["Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients"
            chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-2-respiratory-support-for-covid-19-patients)).

            a.  There is no evidence of survival benefit of inhaled
                vasodilators in ARDS, and there are risks of viral
                aerosolization when connecting the device ([[Fuller et
                al, *Chest*,
                2015]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742022);
                [[Gebistorf et al, *Cochrane Database Syst
                Rev*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
                [2016]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347773);
                [[Afshari et al, *Cochrane Database Syst Rev*,
                2017]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806480))

        2.  To reduce RV afterload in hemodynamically significant RV
            failure in consultation with cardiology

b.  **Instructions for use:**

    i.  If inhaled vasodilators are used, they should reevaluated at 4
        hours

        1.  [Inhaled Epoprostenol:]{.underline}

            a.  Start continuous nebulization at 0.05mcg/kg/min based on
                IBW

                i.  If no improvement in P/F ratio in 2 hours, wean off
                    by decreasing 0.01mcg/kg/min every hour

        2.  [Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):]{.underline}

            a.  Strong consideration in refractory ARDS that does not
                respond to inhaled epoprostenol.

                i.  Limited *in vitro* data notes that iNO at high doses
                    inhibits replication of SARS-CoV, but this has not
                    been studied *in vivo*. ([Akerstrom et
                    al,]{.underline} [[*J Virol*,]{.underline} [
                    ]{.underline}
                    [2005]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650225);
                    [[Gebistorf et al, *Cochrane Database Syst
                    Rev*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
                    [2016]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347773))

                ii. iNO may be included in future trial protocols, such
                    as early initiation in milder disease
                    (non-intubated).

Systemic Corticosteroids
------------------------

a.  **Data on corticosteroids for COVID-19:**

    i.  Most studies show negative effects of corticosteroids on similar
        viruses

        1.  There is no clinical evidence of net benefit from steroids
            in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infection, and
            observational data show increased mortality, more secondary
            infections, impaired viral clearance and more adverse
            effects in survivors (*e.g.,* psychosis, diabetes, avascular
            necrosis) ([[Lee et al,]{.underline} [*J Clin
            Virol*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
            [2004]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15494274);
            [[Stockman et al, *PLoS Med*,
            2006]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968120);
            [[Arabi]{.underline} [et al,]{.underline} [*Am J Respir Crit
            Care Med*,
            2018]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161116);
            [[WHO, *COVID-19 Interim guidance*, March
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected);
            [[Wu et al, *JAMA Int Med*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).

    ii. However, a new retrospective cohort (201 patients, 84 \[42%\] of
        whom developed ARDS) demonstrated that among patients with ARDS,
        methylprednisolone decreased risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
        0.20-0.72) ([[Wu et al, *JAMA Int Med*,]{.underline} [
        ]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).

b.  **Recommendation**:

    i.  **We recommend against using steroids for COVID-19 except as
        part of a clinical trial or if treating another indication**

        1.  This is in line with WHO guidance ([[WHO, *COVID-19 Interim
            guidance*, March
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).

    ii. If required, use corticosteroids at the lowest dose for the
        shortest duration:

        1.  Asthma or COPD exacerbation

            a.  40mg prednisone PO or 30mg methylprednisolone IV, once
                daily x 3-5 days

        2.  Shock with history of chronic steroid use \> 10mg prednisone
            daily:

            a.  50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock

        3.  Multipressor shock without history of chronic steroid use

            a.  50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock

Anti-IL6 Agents (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab) 
-----------------------------------------

a.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  IL-6 activates T cells and macrophages, among other cell types
        (see [["Cytokine Activation Syndrome"
        section]{.underline}](#cytokine-activation-syndrome) in
        [["Shock"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-5-shock-septic-cardiogenic-and-cytokine-storm)).

        1.  IL-6 inhibitors are approved for cytokine activation
            syndrome complications related to Chimeric Antigen Receptor
            T cell (CAR-T) therapy ([Brudno and
            Kochenderfer,]{.underline} [[*Blood Rev*,]{.underline} [
            ]{.underline}
            [2019]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528964);
            [[Rubin et al, *Brain*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
            [2019]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891590)).

        2.  IL-6 levels are reported to correlate with severe COVID-19

        3.  While patients have peripheral lymphopenia, BAL fluid is
            often lymphocytic, suggesting that IL-6 inhibition and
            prevention of T cell activation may be protective.

b.  **Recommendation:**

    i.  We do not recommend routine use at this time

        1.  There are anecdotal reports of benefit of tocilizumab in
            COVID-19 patients but no rigorous studies are available
            (Anecdotal reports from Italy; [[National Health Commission
            & State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,
            *Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus
            Pneumonia*]{.underline} [*\[Trial Version 7\]*, March
            2020]{.underline}](http://busan.china-consulate.org/chn/zt/4/P020200310548447287942.pdf))

    ii. For severe cytokine activation syndrome cases (see [["Other
        Guidance"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-9-neurologic-manifestations)):

        a.  To be used in conjunction with Infectious Disease
            consultation in severe COVID-19 disease with suspicion of
            cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

            i.  Retrospective reviews in patients with rheumatological
                disease suggested a possible increase in serious
                bacterial infection, so it may be reasonable to exercise
                caution if secondary infection is clinically suspected.
                However, tocilizumab is routinely used at BWH (*e.g.*,
                CRS in patients after CAR-T cell treatment) without
                obvious increase in bacterial infection.

c.  **Dosing regimens:**

    i.  Tocilizumab 4-8mg/kg (suggested dose 400mg) IV x1 (anti-IL6R
        mAb)

        1.  Dose can be repeated 12h later if inadequate response to the
            first dose. Total dose should be no more than 800mg.
            Tocilizumab should not be administered more than twice.

        2.  Common adverse effects include:

            a.  Transaminitis (AST, ALT) \> 22%

            b.  Infusion reaction 4-20%

            c.  Hypercholesterolemia 20%

            d.  Upper respiratory tract infection 7%

            e.  Neutropenia 2-7%

    ii. Alternative: Siltuximab 11mg/kg IV x1 (anti-IL6 mAb)

        1.  Common adverse effects include:

            a.  Edema \>26%

            b.  Upper respiratory infection \>26%

            c.  Pruritus / skin rash 28%

            d.  Hyperuricemia 11%

            e.  Lower respiratory tract infection 8%

            f.  Thrombocytopenia 8%

            g.  Hypotension 4%

Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine
----------------------------------

a.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) is an anti-malarial 4-aminoquinoline
        shown to have in vitro (but not yet in-vivo) activity against
        diverse RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-1 ([T]{.underline}[[ouret
        and de Lamballerie, *Antivir Res*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32147496)).

    ii. HQ is thought to act through multiple mechanisms ([Devaux et
        al,]{.underline} [[*Int J Antimicrob Agent*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171740)):

        1.  **Inhibition of viral entry.** HQ inhibits synthesis of
            sialic acids and interferes with protein glycosylation,
            which may disrupt interactions necessary for viral
            attachment and entry ([[Vincent et al,]{.underline} [*Virol
            J*,
            2005]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115318);
            [[Olofsson et al, *Lancet Infect Dis,*]{.underline}
            [2005]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15766653)).

        2.  **Inhibition of viral release into the host cell.** HQ
            blocks endosomal acidification, which activates endosomal
            proteases. These proteases are required to initiate
            coronavirus/endosome fusion that releases viral particles
            into the cell ([[Yang et al, *J Virol*]{.underline}
            [2004]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140961)).

        3.  **Reduction of viral infectivity.** HQ has been shown to
            inhibit protein glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of
            viral proteins. Studies on other RNA viruses have shown a
            resulting accumulation of non-infective viral particles, or
            an inability of viral particles to bud out of the host cell
            ([[Savarino et al, *J Acquir*]{.underline} [*Immune Defic
            Syndr*,]{.underline}
            [2004]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15076236);
            [[Klumperman et al, *J Virol*,
            1994]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8083990)).

        4.  **Immune modulation.** HQ reduces toll-like receptors and
            cGAS-STING signaling. It has been shown to reduce release of
            a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from several immune
            cell types ([Schrezenmeier and Dorner,]{.underline} [[*Nat
            Rev Rheum*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034323)).

b.  **Data:**

    i.  An expert consensus group out of China suggests that Chloroquine
        improved lung imaging and shortened disease course ([Zhonghua et
        al,]{.underline} [[*CMAPH*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075365)).
        Chloroquine will be included in the next treatment guidelines
        from the National Health Commission, but the specific data on
        which this is based is not available yet ([[Gao et al, *Biosci
        Trends*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550)).

    ii. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine
        in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro ([[Yao et al, *Clin Infect
        Dis*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150618))

c.  **Recommendation:**

    i.  Strong consideration of hydroxychloroquine in patients who
        require supplemental oxygen, or in those not on supplemental
        oxygen but at high risk for progression to severe disease, who
        are not candidates for other clinical trials.

d.  **Dosing *(from published literature)*:**

    i.  Hydroxychloroquine:

        1.  400mg PO BID on the first day, followed by 200mg q12 (q8h if
            concerns for absorption) for 5-10 days

    ii. Chloroquine (not available at BWH and no plans to start use):

        1.  500mg Chloroquine phosphate 500mg PO BID for 10 days

        2.  Increased toxicity compared to hydroxychloroquine with
            potential adverse effects including:

            a.  Prolonged QT interval and risk of Torsade de pointes

            b.  Cardiomyopathy

            c.  Bone marrow suppression

            d.  Contraindicated in epilepsy and porphyria

e.  **Monitoring**

    i.  If hydroxychloroquine is being administered with azithromycin,
        there should be vigilant QTc monitoring:

        1.  Obtain baseline ECG and daily ECG

        2.  Discontinue all other QT prolonging agents

        3.  Maintain continuous telemetry while under treatment

        4.  Do not start if QTc \>500 or 550 with pacing or BBB.

        5.  Discontinue if there is an increase in PVCs or non-sustained
            PMVT.

    ii. There is a reported risk of hydroxychloroquine induced
        cardiomyopathy. Case series and reports have found this to be a
        long-term (years) and dose-dependent phenomenon. Given the
        anticipated short duration in COVID-19, it is not an expected
        risk ([[Nord et al, *Semin Arthritis Rheum*,
        2004]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15079764)).

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters via the same
        cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV: angiotensin converting enzyme
        II (ACE2) ([[Paules et al*, JAMA,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31971553)).
        SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have a higher affinity to ACE2 than
        SARS-CoV.

        1.  ACE2 is expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, and
            kidneys. ACEi and ARBs in animal models increase the
            expression of ACE2 ([[Zheng et al, *Nat Rev Cardiol*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32139904)),
            though this has not been confirmed in human studies. This
            has led to the hypothesis that ACE-I and ARBs, might worsen
            myocarditis or precipitate ACS.

        2.  It has also been hypothesized that the upregulation of ACE2
            is therapeutic in COVID-19 and that ARBs might be protective
            in during infection ([Gurwitz D,]{.underline} [[*Drug Dev
            Res*,
            2020]{.underline}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32129518)).

b.  **Recommendation:**

    i.  For outpatients:

        1.  We recommend against discontinuing outpatient ACEi/ARBs.

    ii. For inpatients:

        1.  We recommend against routine discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs,
            unless otherwise indicated (*e.g.,* acute kidney injury,
            hypotension, shock, etc).

    iii. Rationale

         1.  The American College of Cardiology, American Heart
             Association and Heart Failure Society of America joint
             statement recommends against discontinuing ACE-I and ARBs
             in patients with COVID-19 ([[Bozkurt et al,]{.underline}
             *[HFSA/ACC/AHA Statement Addresses Concerns Re: Using RAAS
             Antagonists in COVID-19,]{.underline}*
             [2020]{.underline}](http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/17/08/59/hfsa-acc-aha-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-raas-antagonists-in-covid-19)).
             This remains an area of investigation and it is unclear how
             these medications affect patients with COVID-19.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
----------------------------------------------

a.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via ACE2. ACE2 is upregulated by
        ibuprofen in animal models, and this might contribute to
        increased pathology (see [["Angiotensin Converting Enzyme
        Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)"
        section]{.underline}](#angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-ace-i-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers-arb)
        of this chapter).

b.  **Recommendation:**

    i.  Consider acetaminophen instead of NSAIDs if possible; risk /
        benefit should be discussed with patients and treatment team.

        1.  Reports from France indicate possible increase in mortality
            with ibuprofen in COVID-19 infection, but these reports have
            not been corroborated ([[Fang et al, *Lancet Respir
            Med*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171062);
            [[Day M, *BMJ*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184201)).

        2.  WHO clarified on 3/20/20 it does not recommend avoiding
            NSAIDs as intially stated 3/18/20 ([[WHO, *COVID-19 Interim
            guidance*, March
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).

Blood Products 
--------------

a.  **Recommendation:**

    i.  Restrictive transfusion strategy (Hct \> 21, Hgb \> 7) is
        recommended unless the patient is actively bleeding or there is
        concern for acute coronary syndrome.

        1.  Parsimony is encouraged given limited supplies (blood drives
            are limited by social distancing)

        2.  Acute coronary syndrome: Hgb \> 10

        3.  Oncology patients: Hgb \>7

        4.  All others: Hgb \> 7

        5.  Massive transfusion protocol, as a very limited resource,
            will need to be activated only by the ICU attending

    ii. Other blood products:

        1.  Treat bleeding not numbers

        2.  FFP or 4 factor-PCC (lower volume) for active bleeding in
            setting of known or suspected coagulation abnormalities

        3.  Warfarin reversal: use 4 factor-PCC given longer effect and
            lower volume

        4.  Platelets: goal \> 30K unless actively bleeding

b.  ***Rationale***: Volume overload is of particular concern in
    patients with COVID-19 so transfusions may be harmful. Randomized
    controlled trials of ICU patients have shown that a conservative
    transfusion strategy (Hgb \> 7) is associated with less pulmonary
    edema, fewer cardiac events, fewer transfusions (likely fewer
    transfusion reactions) and no evidence of harm compared to a liberal
    transfusion strategy. ([[Hébert et al, *N Engl J Med*,]{.underline}

Chapter 4: Cardiac Complications of COVID-19
============================================

Acute Cardiac Injury
--------------------

a.  **Definition:**

    i.  Defined in studies as troponin \> 99^th^ percentile, or abnormal
        EKG or echocardiographic findings ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
        Non-specific.

b.  **Incidence**:

    i.  Incidence of 7-22% in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in
        China ([Ruan et al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care
        Med*,]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
        [[Wang et al,]{.underline} [*JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);
        [[Chen et al, *Lancet*,]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143)).

c.  **Prognostic implications:**

    i.  ACI is higher in non-survivors (59%, n=32) than survivors (1%,
        n=1) ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

    ii. ACI is higher in ICU patients (22%, n=22) compared to non-ICU
        patients (2%, n=2) ([[Wang et al, *JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570))

d.  **Time course:**

    i.  Troponin rise and acute cardiac injury tend to be late
        manifestations.

        1.  Troponin increased rapidly from \~14 days from illness
            onset, after the onset of respiratory failure ([[Zhou et al,
            *Lancet*,]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

        2.  Among non-survivors, a steady rise in troponin I levels was
            observed throughout the disease course from day 4 of illness
            through day 22 ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

e.  **Mechanism:**

    i.  The mechanism is unknown, though several have been proposed,
        based on very limited data outside of case series and reports
        ([Ruan et al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care Med*,
        2020]{.underline}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
        [[Hu et al, *Eur Heart J*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300);
        [[Zeng et al, *Preprints*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1))

        a.  Possible direct toxicity through viral invasion into cardiac
            myocytes (*i.e.*, myocarditis)

        b.  Acute coronary syndrome and demand ischemia

        c.  Stress or cytokine-mediated cardiomyopathy (*i.e.,*
            Takotsubo's)

Cardiovascular Testing 
----------------------

a.  **Troponin:**

    i.  ICU patients: Check hsTrop daily and SCvO2 daily

    ii. Inpatients: Check hsTrop every other day

        1.  If hsTrop \> 200 ng/L

            a.  Obtain 12-lead ECG

            b.  Perform point-of-care US (POCUS) if you are trained to
                do so

            c.  If no new ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities,
                continue to monitor every other day hsTrop

b.  **Telemetry:**

    i.  Telemetry should be used for all critically-ill patients

    ii. At BWH, COVID-19 floor patients also have telemetry.

    iii. For hospitals, with resource-limitations, telemetry is most
         important for patients who meet AHA criteria ([Sandau et
         al,]{.underline} [[*Circulation,*
         2017]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28974521)).

c.  **ECGs:**

    i.  Daily ECGs are reasonable for individuals with severe COVID-19.

        1.  When possible, print ECGs from the in-room monitor to
            minimize contamination of equipment.

d.  **TTE:**

    i.  Do not order routine TTEs on COVID-19 patients.

        1.  Cardiology consult or a trained provider should perform
            POCUS if:

            a.  Significant troponin elevation or decline in ScvO2/MvO2

            b.  Shock

            c.  New heart failure (not pre-existing heart failure)

            d.  New persistent arrhythmia

            e.  Significant ECG changes

    ii. If abnormalities are identified on POCUS (e.g. new reduction in
        LVEF \< 50%), a formal TTE should be obtained and cardiology
        consulted.

        1.  Where possible order limited TTEs instead of full TTEs to
            conserve resources.

e.  **Stress Testing:**

    i.  Stress testing is likely not indicated in individuals with
        active COVID.

    ii. Any question of possible stress testing should be directed to
        cardiology.

Arrhythmias
-----------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Case series report the occurrence of unspecified arrhythmias in
        17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=23 of 138), with
        higher rate in ICU patients (44%, n=16) compared to non-ICU
        patients (7%, n=7) ([[Wang et al, *JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570)).

    ii. There are anecdotal reports of VT and VF as a late manifestation
        of COVID-19. No specific published findings were identified.

b.  **Workup:**

    1.  Telemetry, 12-lead EKG, cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, TFT

    2.  ScvO2 if central line present (goal SCVO2 \> 60%)

    3.  POCUS to assess LV and RV function

        a.  Obtain formal TTE if abnormalities of any of the above

c.  **Treatment:**

    i.  Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter

        1.  Beta blockade if no evidence of heart failure or shock

            a.  If significant heart failure or borderline BPs, use
                amiodarone. There is no known increased concern for
                amiodarone lung toxicity

        2.  If unstable, synchronized DCCV with 200 Joules biphasic

    ii. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)

        1.  Unstable/pulseless: initiate ACLS

        2.  Stable:

            a.  Cardiology consult (may represent evolving myocardial
                involvement)

            b.  Amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 or lidocaine 100mg IV x 1

Acute Coronary Syndromes
------------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  There is no current available data on the incidence of ACS in
        COVID. However, we presume that due to the presence of ACE2
        receptors on the endothelium, and the known increased risk of
        ACS in influenza that there is a possible increased incidence of
        ACS among COVID-19 patients.

        1.  The incidence of ACS is about 6 times as high within seven
            days of an influenza diagnosis than during control
            interval - incidence ratio 6.05 (95% CI, 3.86 to 9.50)
            ([Kwong et al,]{.underline} [[*NEJM*,
            2018]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365305)).

b.  **Workup:**

    i.  Elevated troponin/ECG changes alone may not be able to
        discriminate between:

        1.  Coronary thrombosis

        2.  Demand-related ischemia

        3.  Myocarditis

    ii. Determination of ACS will rely on all evidence available:

        1.  Symptoms (if able to communicate)

            a.  New dyspnea, chest pain, anginal equivalents

        2.  Regional ECG changes

        3.  Rate of change of Troponin changes (*i.e.*, acute rise
            suggests ACS)

        4.  Echo findings (*e.g.*, new RWMA)

    iii. When in doubt, request a cardiology consult.

c.  **Management:**

    i.  Medical management of ACS should be coordinated with cardiology

        1.  Treat with full dose aspirin, clopidogrel (if not bleeding),
            heparin, oxygen (if hypoxemic), statin, nitrates (if
            hypertensive), and opioids (if persistent pain during
            medical management).

            a.  Beta blockers should be used with caution given possible
                concomitant myocarditis/decompensated heart failure.

    ii. As of the time of this writing, the cath lab will take COVID-19
        patients, even if ventilated.

        1.  If resources become constrained and door-to-balloon time is
            no longer adequate, cardiology may decide to use lytic
            medications for COVID-19 STEMI patients in lieu of PCI.

Pericarditis and Myocarditis
----------------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Myocarditis and pericarditis are potential manifestations of
        COVID-19 and source of Acute Cardiac Injury, based on case
        reports/case series ([Ruan et al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care
        Med*,]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
        [[Zeng et al, *Preprints*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1);
        [[Hu et al, *Eur Heart J*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300))

    ii. However, there is currently no evidence of proven pericarditis
        or myocarditis, either by biopsy or cMRI.

b.  **Diagnosis:**

    i.  Likely no role for endomyocardial biopsy

    ii. cMRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with a
        cardiology consult team.

c.  **Management:**

    i.  Supportive for heart failure and direct viral treatments

    ii. The use of anti-inflammatory medications such as Colchicine and
        Ibuprofen should also be discussed with the cardiology consult
        team as this literature is evolving.

Chapter 5: Shock: Septic, Cardiogenic, and Cytokine Storm
=========================================================

Undifferentiated Shock in COVID
-------------------------------

a.  **Definition:**

    i.  Acute onset of new and sustained hypotension (MAP \< 65 or SBP
        \< 90) with signs of hypoperfusion requiring IVF or vasopressors
        to maintain adequate blood pressure

b.  **Time course:**

    i.  Patients rarely present in shock on admission

        1.  Natural history seems to favor the development of shock
            after multiple days of critical illness.

c.  **Etiology:**

    i.  The range of reasons for shock is wide and more variable than
        for most patients and includes:

        1.  Cardiogenic shock

        2.  Secondary bacterial infection

        3.  Cytokine storm

d.  **Workup for new undifferentiated shock:**

    i.  Assess for severity of end organ damage:

        1.  UOP, Mental status, Lactate, BUN/creatinine, electrolytes,
            LFTs

    ii. Obtain a FULL infectious workup, which includes all of the
        following:

        1.  Labs: CBC with differential. Note that most COVID patients
            are lymphopenic (83%). However, new leukocytosis can occur
            and left-shift can be used as a part of clinical picture
            ([[Guan et al, *N Engl J Med*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109013)).
            Two sets of blood cultures, LFTs (for cholangitis/acalculous
            cholecystitis), urinalysis (with reflex to culture), sputum
            culture (if safely obtained via inline suctioning, do not
            perform bronchoscopy or sputum induction), procalcitonin at
            0 and 48h (do not withhold early antibiotics on the basis of
            procalcitonin*),* urine Strep and legionella antigens

        2.  Portable CXR (avoid CT unless absolutely necessary)

        3.  Full skin exam

    iii. Assess for cardiogenic shock

         1.  Assess extremities: warm or cool on exam

         2.  Assess patient volume status: JVP, CVP, edema, CXR

         3.  Assess pulse pressure: If \< 25% of the SBP, correlates
             highly with a reduction in cardiac index to less than 2.2
             with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%
             ([[Stevenson and Perloff, *JAMA*,]{.underline}
             [1989]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913385))

         4.  Perform POCUS if trained to do so

             a.  For TTE protocols see [["Cardiac Complications of
                 COVID-19"
                 chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).

         5.  Labs: Obtain an SCV02 or MV02 if the patient has central
             access, troponin x2, NT proBNP, A1c, lipid profile, TSH

         6.  EKG (and telemetry)

         7.  Calculate estimated Fick Cardiac Output

             a.  CO (Cardiac Output), L/min = VO~2~/ \[(SaO~2~ - SvO~2~)
                 x Hb x 13.4)\],

                 i.  where VO~2~ = 125 mL O~2~/min x BSA, where BSA =
                     \[(Height, cm x Weight, kg)/ 3,600 \]^½^; in
                     patients aged ≥70, use 110 mL O~2~ x BSA for VO~2~

             b.  MDcalc online calculators: [[Fick
                 CO]{.underline}](http://www.mdcalc.com/cardiac-output-ficks-formula),
                 [[BSA]{.underline}](http://www.mdcalc.com/body-mass-index-bmi-body-surface-area-bsa)

    iv. Assess for other causes of shock:

        1.  Vasoplegia:

            a.  Run medication list for recent cardiosuppressive
                medications, vasodilatory agents, antihypertensives

        2.  Adrenal insufficiency:

            a.  Unless high pretest probability of adrenal
                insufficiency, we recommend against routine cortisone
                stimulation testing

        3.  Obstruction:

            a.  PE (given the elevated risk of thrombosis)

            b.  Tamponade (given elevated risk of pericarditis)

            c.  Obstruction from PEEP

        4.  Cytokine storm (see [["Cytokine Activation Syndrome"
            section]{.underline}](#cytokine-activation-syndrome) in this
            chapter below)

        5.  Allergic reactions to recent medications

        6.  Neurogenic shock is uncommon in this context

        7.  Hypovolemia:

            a.  Bleeding

            b.  Insensible losses from fever

            c.  Diarrhea/vomiting

Differentiating Shock
---------------------

Septic Shock and Secondary Infections 
-------------------------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  The reported rates of sepsis and septic shock are not reported
        consistently in currently available case series

        1.  Secondary bacterial infections are reported:

            a.  20% of non-survivors ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
                2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076))

            b.  16% of non-survivors ([Ruan et al,]{.underline}
                [[*Intensive Care Med*,
                2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))

            c.  12-19% In H1N1 epidemic ([MacIntyre et al,]{.underline}
                [[*BMC Infect Dis*,
                2018]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526505))

    ii. Concurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in at least
        one case (possibly due to lymphopenia)

b.  **Antibiosis:**

    i.  Early empiric antibiotics should be initiated within 1 hour (see
        [["Antibiotic Stewardship"
        section]{.underline}](#antibiotic-selection) within [["COVID-19
        Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials))

c.  **Conservative Fluid Management:**

    i.  Goal MAP \> 65mmHg

    ii. Start Norepinephrine while determining the etiology of
        undifferentiated shock

    iii. We do not recommend conventional 30cc/kg resuscitation

         1.  Give 250-500cc IVF and assess in 15-30 minutes for:

             a.  Increase \> 2 in CVP

             b.  Increase in MAP or decrease in pressor requirement

                 i.  Use isotonic crystalloids; Lactated Ringer's
                     solution is preferred where possible. Avoid
                     hypotonic fluids, starches, or colloids

         2.  Repeat 250-500cc IVF boluses; Use dynamic measures of fluid
             responsiveness

             a.  Pulse Pressure Variation: can be calculated in
                 mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmia;
                 PPV \>12% is sensitive and specific for volume
                 responsiveness

             b.  Straight Leg Raise: raise legs to 45° w/ supine torso
                 for at least one minute. A change in pulse pressure
                 of \> 12% has sensitivity of 60% & specificity of 85%
                 for fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated
                 patients; less accurate if spontaneously breathing

             c.  Ultrasound evaluation of IVC collapsibility should only
                 be undertaken by trained personnel to avoid
                 contamination of ultrasound

         3.  For further guidance, Conservative Fluid Management
             protocols are available from from FACCT Lite trial
             ([[Grissom et al,]{.underline} [* Crit Care Med*,
             2015]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463)).

         4.  *Rationale*: COVID-19 clinical reports indicate the
             majority of patients present with respiratory failure
             without shock. ARDS is mediated in part by pulmonary
             capillary leak, and randomized controlled trials of ARDS
             indicate that a conservative fluid strategy is protective
             in this setting ([[Grissom et al,]{.underline} [* Crit Care
             Med*,
             2015]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463);
             [[Famous et al, *Am J Respir Crit Care Med,*]{.underline}
             [2017]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27513822);
             [[Silversides et al, *Int Care Med,*]{.underline}
             [2017]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734109);
             [[WHO, *COVID-19 Interim guidance*, March
             2020]{.underline}](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).

d.  **Pressor management**

    i.  Unless new evidence emerges, standard choices for distributive
        shock (*i.e.*, norepinephrine then vasopressin) are recommended,
        with high vigilance for the development of cardiogenic shock,
        addressed in the next section.

e.  **Corticosteroids**

    i.  See [["Systemic Corticosteroids"
        section]{.underline}](#systemic-corticosteroids) within
        [["COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials).

        1.  Stress dose hydrocortisone should still be considered in
            patients on \> 2 pressors*.*

Cardiogenic Shock
-----------------

e.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Heart failure or cardiogenic shock was observed in 23% (n=44
        of 191) of hospitalized patients in one case series ([[Zhou et
        al, *Lancet*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
        Moreover, there were higher rates in non-survivors (52%, n=28)
        compared to survivors (12%, n=16). Among 21 patients admitted to
        an ICU in Washington State 33% (n=7) developed a new
        cardiomyopathy ([Arentz et al,]{.underline} [[*JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191259)).
        Notably, these patients tended to be older with more
        comorbidities and had a high mortality (11 of the 21 died).

    ii. Heart failure or myocardial damage contributed to death in 39%
        (n=29) of deaths in a series of 68 patients in Wuhan. Most (n=22
        of 29) had concomitant respiratory failure ([Ruan et
        al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care Med*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452)).

f.  **Diagnosis:**

    i.  Significant concern for cardiogenic shock if any of the
        following are present with evidence of hypoperfusion (*e.g.*,
        elevated lactate):

        1.  Elevated NT-proBNP, or

        2.  CvO2 \< 60% (PvO2 \< 35 mm Hg), or

        3.  Echocardiogram with depressed LV and/or RV function

g.  **Time course:**

    i.  Cardiogenic shock may present late in the course of illness even
        after improvement of respiratory symptoms, and manifest as a
        precipitous clinical deterioration in the setting of an acute
        decline in LVEF (see [["Acute Cardiac Injury"
        section]{.underline}](#acute-cardiac-injury) in [["Cardiac
        Complications"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19)).

h.  **Etiology:**

    i.  See [["Acute Cardiac Injury"
        section]{.underline}](#acute-cardiac-injury) in [["Cardiac
        Complications"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).

    ii. Mechanism is unknown, potentially direct viral toxicity, ACS, or
        stress cardiomyopathy.

i.  **Workup:**

    i.  Rule out ACS and complete the initial work up as described in
        [["Cardiac Complications"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).

    ii. Ongoing monitoring:

        1.  Labs: Trend troponins to peak, SCvO2 (obtained by upper body
            CVC) or MvO2 q8-12h or with clinical change, Lactate q4-6h,
            LFTs daily (for hepatic congestion)

        2.  Daily EKGs or prn with clinical deterioration

        3.  Trend troponin to peak

    iii. All cardiogenic shock cases require cardiovascular consult

         1.  PA catheters may be placed bedside by experienced
             providers, with preference for use only in mixed shock or
             complex cases with cardiology guidance

j.  **Medical management:**

    i.  Close collaboration with the cardiovascular consultation service
        is recommended

    ii. Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR
        800-1000, SCvO2 \> 60%, CI \> 2.2

        1.  Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize
            other parameters

    iii. How to achieve goals:

         1.  Continue titration of norepinephrine gtt for goal MAP 65-75

         2.  Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP \> 14, PCWP \>18, PAD \>
             25

         3.  Initiate inotropic support:

             a.  Dobutamine gtt for SCvO2 \< 60%, CI \< 2.2 and
                 MAP \> 65. Start at 2mcg/kg/min. Up-titrate by
                 1-2mcg/kg/min every 30-60 minutes for goal parameters.
                 Alternative strategies should be considered once dose
                 exceeds 5mcg/kg/min. Maximum dose is 10mcg/kg/min.

         4.  Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium
             channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued.

k.  **Candidacy for Mechanical Support**

    i.  The benefit of Mechanical Support in COVID-19 is not yet clear.
        In one study of patients with severe COVID-19, five (83%) of six
        patients receiving ECMO died ([[Yang et al, *Lancet Respir Med*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632)).
        There is concern that the further decrease of lymphocytes from
        ECMO could contribute to higher mortality. However, this is a
        very small study and more information is needed.

    ii. Patients who experience the following should prompt an immediate
        call to the cardiovascular medicine consult service for
        consideration of mechanical support:

        1.  Dobutamine gtt at 5mcg/kg/min (or unable to tolerate
            dobutamine due to tachyarrhythmias) and SCVO2 \< 60% or CI
            \< 2.2

        2.  Lactate \> 4 after medical therapy

    iii. The criteria for ECMO and other mechanical cardiovascular
         support varies among centers and are difficult to develop under
         typical circumstances. The unclear trajectory of the COVID-19
         pandemic makes these evaluations even more difficult. Please
         refer to the separate BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular Medicine
         guidelines which are in development.

> The following does not reflect the recommendation of the BWH ECMO and
> Cardiovascular services. However, for the purposes of general
> education, a hypothetical set of [inclusion criteria]{.underline} for
> ECMO or MCS could cover:

1.  Younger age

2.  Expected life expectancy \>6 months pre-hospitalization

3.  No evidence of solid or liquid malignancy

4.  Able to tolerate anticoagulation

5.  Platelets \>50,000

6.  Absence of severe peripheral arterial disease

7.  No evidence of irreversible neurological injury

8.  Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

9.  Cannot have profound respiratory failure (defined as requiring prone
    > ventilation at time of consult for MCS or having PaO2:FiO2 ratio
    > \< 150) (for MCS other than ECMO)

Cytokine Activation Syndrome
----------------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine
        storm syndrome and secondary HLH ([[Mehta et al*,
        Lancet,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192578)).
        Patients who had cytokine storm developed rapid progression to
        ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure ([[Chen et al*,
        Lancet,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143))

b.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  Neutrophil activation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of
        cytokine storm and ARDS ([[Wu et al*, JAMA Intern
        Med,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).
        [[Wu et
        al]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)
        found that COVID-19 confirmed patients with ARDS have higher
        neutrophil counts, average 7.04 (95% CI: 3.98 to 10.12) vs.
        those without ARDS, average 3.06 (2.03 to 5.56)

    ii. Similar patterns of cytokine storm and ARDS have been seen with
        SARS, MERS ([[Kim et al*, J Korean Med Sci,*]{.underline}
        [2016]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709848))

    iii. Other studies have suggested that increased proinflammatory
         cytokines in the serum are associated with pulmonary injury in
         SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 ([[Wong et al*, Clin Exp
         Immunol,*]{.underline}
         [2004]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030519))

c.  **Workup:**

    i.  Suspect if clinical deterioration with shock and multiorgan
        failure

    ii. CBC with diff, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, ferritin, liver
        function test, triglycerides, c-reactive protein (CRP) ([Ruan et
        al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care Med*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))

        1.  CRP seems to correlate with disease severity and prognosis
            of COVID-19 ([Ruan et al,]{.underline} [[*Intensive Care
            Med*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
            [[Young et al*, JAMA,*]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125362))

        2.  An HScore ([MDcalc online calculator]{.underline}) may be
            helpful in estimating the probability of secondary HLH in
            these patients

d.  **Management:**

    i.  If high suspicion, discuss with ID about the use of IVIG,
        steroids, cytokine blockade, particularly IL-6 pathway and
        perhaps IL-1 (see [["Anti-IL6 Agents"
        section]{.underline}](#anti-il6-agents-tocilizumab-siltuximab)
        within [["COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)).
        While steroids have been implicated with worse lung injury and
        outcomes, they may be beneficial in the hyperinflammatory state.

Chapter 6: Cardiac Arrest
=========================

Management of Cardiac Arrest
----------------------------

a.  **Early goals of care conversations are imperative.**

    i.  The aim is to avoid unnecessary codes in patients without a
        reversible underlying condition.

b.  **Health care workers should be protected in code situations:**

    i.  PPE should be worn by all healthcare workers, even if donning
        prolongs time the patient spends in a low-flow state during
        cardiac arrest.

    ii. Codes should be run with an automated compression device where
        available and minimal personnel.

c.  **Full code guidelines are forthcoming and will be included here
    when available.**

Chapter 7: Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations
====================================================

Thrombotic Disease
------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Unclear incidence, though case reports suggest there may be
        increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients
        ([Xie et al,]{.underline} [*[Radiol Cardiothoracic
        Imaging,]{.underline}*
        [2020]{.underline}](http://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200067))

b.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  The mechanism for VTE are unknown and likely multifactorial:

        1.  Systemic inflammatory response as seen in sepsis

        2.  Stasis/critical illness

        3.  Possibly direct endothelial damage from viral injury/ACE2
            binding

    ii. Colleagues from Wuhan have reported finding microthrombi in
        pulmonary vasculature on autopsy ([[Luo et al,
        *Preprints*,]{.underline} [2020
        preprint]{.underline}](http://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0407/v2)),
        which could contribute to local V/Q mismatch or hydrostatic
        changes causing edema. However these mechanisms remain entirely
        hypothetical.

    iii. One theory: SARS-CoV Spike protein can be cleaved by FXa and
         FIIa. Cleavage of the Spike protein activates it which promotes
         infectivity. By extension, it is hypothesized that
         anticoagulation might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. There is
         a small case series suggesting dipyridamole may be useful,
         though anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents require further
         investigation prior to being used therapeutically ([[Liu et al,
         *medRxiv,*]{.underline} [2020
         preprint]{.underline}](http://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557)).

c.  **Management:**

    i.  Initiate prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for all COVID-19
        patients unless otherwise contraindicated

        1.  If CrCl \> 30: Lovenox 40 mg SC daily

        2.  If CrCl \< 30 or AKI: Heparin 5000 units SC TID

        3.  Hold if Platelets \<30,000 or bleeding, start TEDs and SCDs

    ii. If the patient is on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or
        Warfarin for Afib or VTE, switch to full dose anticoagulation
        (LMWH or UFH, as indicated based on renal function or clinical
        scenario).

    iii. While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in
         some severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan given the microthrombi
         in pulmonary vasculature (see "Pathophysiology" above), our
         interpretation of the data is that the risks outweigh the
         benefits at this time, unless documented DVT or PE.

d.  **Prognosis:**

    i.  Higher D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ dysfunction
        syndrome and poorer prognosis ([[Wang et al, *JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);
        [[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
--------------------------------------------

a.  **Incidence/pathophysiology:**

    i.  Limited data: 16 of 183 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had DIC
        ([[Tang et al, *J Thromb Haemost,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).

    ii. Laboratory changes in coagulation parameters and FDP track with
        multi-organ dysfunction ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

b.  **Time course:**

    i.  Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into hospital admission
        ([[Tang et al, *J Thromb Haemost,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).

c.  **Workup:**

    i.  Identify and treat underlying condition

    ii. ISTH DIC score ([MDcalc online calculator]{.underline})

        1.  If score \< 5, no DIC; recalculate in 1-2 days

d.  **Management:**

    i.  If bleeding, give blood products:

        1.  For elevated PT/PTT and bleeding, use FFP or 4F-PCC (KCentra
            is less volume, but must discuss dose with HAT/pharmacy)

    ii. If not bleeding, supportive care:

        1.  If fibrinogen \< 150: FFP, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen
            concentrate (RiaSTAP or Fibryga)

            a.  RiaSTAP and Fibryga are less volume, but dose must be
                discussed with HAT/pharmacy

        2.  Transfuse platelets if \< 30K

    iii. Hold anticoagulation for active bleeding.

         1.  Consider holding anticoagulation if patient requires blood
             products for supportive care, though clinician should weigh
             risks and benefits.

    iv. Start anticoagulation only if:

        1.  Overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot (*i.e.*,
            purpura fulminans)

        2.  There has been no mortality benefit of therapeutic
            anticoagulation in DIC ([[Levi et al, *Blood,*]{.underline}
            [2018]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29255070)).

e.  **Prognosis:**

    i.  DIC is associated with worse survival in COVID-19 patients. Out
        of 183 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 71% of non-survivors had DIC
        (ISTH score ≥ 5; [[MDcalc online
        calculator]{.underline}](http://www.mdcalc.com/isth-criteria-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic))
        compared to 0.6% of survivors ([[Tang et al, *J Thromb
        Haemost,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).

Chapter 8: Renal Manifestations 
===============================

Acute Kidney Injury
-------------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies widely, but estimates range
        from 2.1% to 29%.

b.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  Likely that the most common pathophysiology will be acute
        tubular necrosis (ATN) driven by shock ([Xianghong et
        al]{.underline}[[*, Natl Med J China,*
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145717))
        and in some cases cytokine storm.

        1.  Areas for future research: Some have hypothesized that there
            could direct cellular injury by the virus via angiotensin
            converting enzyme II (ACE2). COVID-19 uses ACE2 for cell
            entry. ACE2 is expressed in proximal renal tubules more than
            glomeruli ([[Fan et al*, medRxiv,*]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418));
            but it remains likely that shock (and in some cases cytokine
            storm) are the main causes of ATN.

c.  **Workup:**

    i.  Monitor Creatinine at least daily

        1.  Studies find variable onset of AKI, from 7 days ([[Cheng et
            al, *medRxiv*, 2020
            preprint]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))
            to 15 days after illness onset ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
            Onset of AKI more rapid and severe in patients with
            underlying CKD ([[Cheng et al, *medRxiv*, 2020
            preprint]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))

    ii. If evidence of rising BUN and/or creatinine, order urinalysis

        1.  Patients may present with proteinuria (44%), hematuria
            (26.9%)

d.  **Management:**

    i.  Consult ICU nephrology early at the first sign of renal injury
        for all COVID-19 confirmed patients

        1.  Do not wait until need for RRT (renal replacement
            therapy)/dialysis for consultation.

        2.  At this time, all confirmed COVID-19 patients should be
            covered by ICU nephrology, not general nephrology

            a.  ICU

            b.  RRT Triage

            c.  Floor

    ii. Managing AKI:

        1.  Minimize nephrotoxic agents

        2.  Give judicious fluids for suspected prerenal insults, but
            discuss with renal if any ambiguity (see [["Shock"
            chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-5-shock-septic-cardiogenic-and-cytokine-storm)
            for conservative fluid recommendations)

e.  **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT):**

    i.  Estimates for RRT range from 1 to 5% of hospitalized patients.
        Among critically ill patients, need for CRRT ranges from 5 to
        23%

        1.  Few studies have reported outcomes of RRT. One case series
            reported that out of 191 patients, 10 received CRRT, and all
            10 died ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

    ii. Renal will be coordinating RRT continuation and initiation

        1.  Indications for dialysis in COVID-19 patients are the same
            as the indications for all patients.

    iii. ICU nephrology will determine the need, timing, and modality of
         renal replacement on a case-by-case basis.

f.  **Prognosis:**

    i.  Increased serum creatine, BUN, AKI, proteinuria, or hematuria
        are each independent risk factors for in-hospital death ([[Cheng
        et al, *medRxiv*, 2020
        preprint]{.underline}](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))

    ii. In two other studies, non-survivors had higher BUN and
        creatinine and higher rates of AKI ([[Wang et al, *JAMA*,
        2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570)*;*
        [[Yang et al*, Lancet Respir Med,*]{.underline}
        [2020)]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632).

    iii. Another study found that higher BUN and creatinine are
         associated with progression to ARDS, and higher BUN (though not
         creatinine) is associated with death (HR 1.06-1.20) ([[Wu et
         al*, JAMA Intern Med,*]{.underline}
         [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).

    iv. In comparison, AKI was found in 6.7% of SARS patients. AKI
        correlated with poor prognosis and 91.7% of patients with AKI
        died (vs 8.8% without AKI, p \< 0.0001) ([[Chu et al*, Kidney
        Int*,]{.underline} [ ]{.underline}
        [2005]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673319)).

Chapter 9: Neurologic Manifestations
====================================

*This section is in process*
----------------------------

Chapter 10: GI Manifestations
=============================

Liver Disease
-------------

a.  **Incidence:**

    i.  Up to 53% of patients had abnormal alanine aminotransferase
        (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ([[Zhang et al*,
        Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,*]{.underline}
        [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145190)).

b.  **Pathophysiology:**

    i.  Possible mechanisms of liver injury include:

        1.  Direct viral infection of liver cells (2-10% of patients
            have diarrhea; COVID-19 found in stool samples)

        2.  Drug hepatotoxicity

        3.  Cytokine storm

        4.  Shock

c.  **Time course:**

    i.  In general, liver injury in mild COVID-19 disease is transient
        and self-resolving. However, liver injury correlates with
        severity

        1.  ALT \> 40 is associated with higher odds of in-hospital
            death ([[Zhou et al, *Lancet*,
            2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).

        2.  AST is associated with progression to ARDS but not death;
            total bilirubin is associated with both progression to ARDS
            and death ([[Wu et al*, JAMA Intern Med,*]{.underline}
            [2020]{.underline}](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).

d.  **Monitoring:**

    i.  Monitor LFTs every third day

        1.  If on hepatotoxic medications, monitor more frequently in
            conjunction with pharmacy.

        2.  If starting Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Chloroquine, monitor
            LFTs daily.

    ii. Workup for other etiologies of liver injury with RUQUS, doppler
        ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, etc., as clinically indicated.

e.  **Management:**

    i.  Consult GI/Hepatology if concern for acute liver failure (severe
        liver injury with elevated bilirubin, encephalopathy, and
        INR \>1.5).

    ii. Run medication list for all possible offending agents and
        discontinue where possible.

    iii. N-Acetyl-Cysteine is not recommended at this time due to
         significant volume load. Chinese studies refer to giving "liver
         protective drugs" in case of severe liver injury but we
         recommend against this for now.

    iv. There are no current guidelines for treatment of COVID-19
        patients with underlying cirrhosis, but societies such as AASLD
        are working on registries of these patients.

Diarrheal illness
-----------------

a.  *This section is in process*

Chapter 11: Considerations for Oncology Patients 
================================================

General principles
------------------

a.  **Data:**

    i.  As of March 16, 2020, there are no available published data
        specific to COVID-19 management in oncologic or immunosuppressed
        patients.

b.  **Oncology Consultation/Coverage:**

    i.  For established DFCI patients, oncology consultation and
        guidance is provided by each patient's primary oncologist (or
        coverage).

        1.  Contact primary oncologist via page, not the general pager.

c.  **Prognosis:**

    i.  Many patients have reasonable or even good prognosis with
        current therapies. Do not assume a prognosis, involve outpatient
        attending.

d.  **Meds:**

    i.  Check in Epic medications tab and in "Research: Active" tab.

e.  **Workup:**

    i.  Labs:

        1.  Weekly glucan/galactomannan in neutropenic/transplant
            patients.

        2.  Specific patient populations may require additional
            monitoring (such as CMV, EBV monitoring in transplant
            patients -- ask outpatient team).

    ii. Exam:

        1.  Examine catheters (port, CVC, others) daily.

        2.  Avoid rectal exams in neutropenic patients, but examine the
            perirectal area if symptoms or persistent fevers.

        3.  Do not give per rectum therapies to neutropenic patients.

f.  **Pain management:**

    i.  Patients with cancer-related pain may have high opiate needs at
        baseline. Opiates should not be stopped but type may need to be
        adjusted in the setting of respiratory failure, renal injury, or
        liver injury.

        1.  Pain / Palliative Care service can help guide dose
            titrations in these situations.

g.  **Goals of Care:**

    i.  Involve primary team whenever possible (recognizing that in
        critical/emergent situations may not be possible).

h.  **Anticoagulation:**

    i.  Thrombosis prophylaxis should be initiated for all patients
        unless otherwise contraindicated, given that both COVID-19
        infection and malignancy increase thrombotic risk, particularly
        with solid tumors.

        1.  See [["Thrombotic Disease"
            section]{.underline}](#thrombotic-disease) within
            [["Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations"
            chapter]{.underline}](#_5s70bzlr4ojz) for guidelines on both
            prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation.

        2.  Remember to hold if platelet count \< 30K.

i.  **Patients with Heme Malignancy and Stem Cell Transplant:**

    i.  Daily exam: Findings are more subtle or absent in neutropenic
        and immune suppressed patients. Examine catheters daily. Avoid
        rectal exam.

j.  **Transfusions:**

    i.  Blood bank reviews orders and will release appropriate products
        (*i.e.*, irradiated, leukoreduced, etc).

        1.  RBC transfusion if Hgb \< 7 or Hct \< 21.

        2.  Platelet transfusion if Platelets \< 10K. Higher transfusion
            goals if needed for procedures or if active bleeding:

            a.  Platelet count \> 20K if mild bleeding (*i.e.*,
                epistaxis, line oozing) or if patient has rigors.

            b.  Platelet count \> 50K if more serious bleeding; may be
                higher for CNS bleeding or neurosurgery required.

        3.  Cryoprecipitate transfusion if fibrinogen \< 100.

        4.  FFP transfusion if procedure needed (INR of FFP = \~1.4).

Febrile Neutropenia
-------------------

a.  **Definition:**

    i.  ANC \< 500 cells/mm3 AND T ≥ 101F or T ≥ 100.5 for 1hr

b.  **Workup:**

    i.  Blood cultures from peripheral (ideally two sets), and each
        lumen of central line (label clearly); UA/sed with urine culture
        (UA may not be as informative with neutropenia); glucan and
        galactomannan (if not checked recently), sputum if able; CXR

        1.  Continue DAILY blood cultures while febrile.

        2.  Monitor serum galactomannan and 1-3-beta glucan once weekly.

        3.  Any positive glucan or galactomannan prompts ID consult.

c.  **Initial Empiric Antibiotics:**

    i.  GNRs: Ceftazidime OR Cefepime

        1.  Alternatives: Piperacillin-tazobactam (2nd line) or
            meropenem (3rd line).

    ii. GPCs: add Vancomycin if hemodynamically unstable, or if MRSA
        pneumonia or catheter-associated infection is suspected. Check
        dosing with pharmacy if able.

d.  **Removal of lines:**

    i.  Catheter removal should be discussed if associated infection is
        suspected - involve primary oncologist and/or ID team to weigh
        risks and benefits, given that not all lines require removal.

e.  **Persistent Neutropenic Fever:**

    i.  If fever persists x3 days despite antibiotics

        1.  Micafungin 100mg IV daily

        2.  Consideration of further imaging even if patient appears
            stable (discuss with oncology / ID).

f.  **Antiinfective course:**

    i.  Anti-Infectives should be continued until the patient has met
        all of these criteria:

        1.  clinically improved, and

        2.  has been afebrile for 48h, and

        3.  has been non-neutropenic for 48h.

Patients with Solid Tumors
--------------------------

a.  **Thrombosis:**

    i.  Patients with solid tumors are at very high risk of thrombosis
        but at lower risk of infection than most heme malignancy
        patients.

b.  **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs):**

    i.  do not significantly immune suppress patients when used alone

    ii. Most common are CTLA-4 inhibitor (ipilimumab) and PD-1/PD-L1
        inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab
        and avelumab).

c.  **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor toxicity:**

    i.  If patient develops organ dysfunction, it may be due to immune
        toxicity- consult the service team of the involved organ system
        and inform primary oncologist.

    ii. Common immune toxicities include pneumonitis / respiratory
        failure (may be difficult to distinguish between COVID19 disease
        or may be aggravated by COVID19 infection), colitis, endocrine
        dysfunction (thyroid, pituitary / hypothalamic, adrenal),
        nephritis. Less common hepatitis, meningitis, dermatitis.

        1.  Check TSH, ACTH, cortisol, T-spot, HIV, HBV, HCV serologies
            if concerned.

    iii. Immune toxicities are usually treated with high dose steroids -
         risks and benefits must be weighed immediately with primary
         oncologist and ID consult teams if immune toxicity is suspected
         concurrent with COVID19 infection.

    iv. BWH/DFCI iTox guidelines can be found
        [[here]{.underline}](http://dfcionline.org/clinical/clinicalresources/immunotherapy-toxicity/)
        on BWH/DFCI intranet.

Chapter 12: The Role of Palliative Care
=======================================

Symptom Management
------------------

a.  *This section is in process*

Goals of Care
-------------

a.  **Assess understanding and sign Health Care Proxy form on
    admission:**

    i.  In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form.

    ii. Make sure families are aware that patients with significant
        comorbid illnesses or who have poor baseline functional or
        health status decompensate rapidly and have very high mortality
        due to COVID-19 (see [["Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers"
        chapter]{.underline}](#chapter-1-non-icu-management-triage-transfers)).

b.  **Goals of Care should be documented and focus on:**

    i.  A patient's desired quality of life

    ii. Tolerance for/desire for invasive measures

    iii. Understanding of disease process

**[Afterword]{.underline}**

We built the first iteration of these guidelines "from the bottom up" in
less than a week with the input of over 50 people. With the help of our
readers, we expect to correct and revise as we as a society learn about
COVID-19.

We hope that this pandemic brings with it a new era of collaboration and
speed in Evidence Based Medicine. We welcome all help, and will be
restructuring this to be more navigable and collaborative in the coming
days.

Currently we are looking for ongoing section editors, please email

ADDENDUM: COVID ICU Bundle Checklist 
====================================

Rationale: Use of a daily checklist ensures that routine quality
measures are in place for each patient. Review Bundle Checklist at the
end of each patient's presentation, every day. [Each section should be
performed unless there is a contraindication or barrier to
implementation]{.underline}. If a contraindication is present, discuss
how barriers may be overcome.

**Ventilator**

🗆 Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)

= turn off sedation

🗆 Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)

= Place patient on Pressure Support 5/5

\- Perform SAT & SBT concurrently if able

\- Contraindications to SAT/SBT include FiO2 \> 50%, PEEP \> 8, O2 sat
\< 90%, pH \< 7.30, SBP \< 90 or MAP \< 60, paralysis, intracranial
pressure \>15, concern for significant bleeding

🗆 If ARDS: goal Vt 4-6 cc/kg of ideal body weight (calculated by
height), plateau pressure \< 30

🗆 Head of bed at \>30 degrees

🗆 Oral care is ordered

**Sedation / Delirium**

🗆 Ask: Is patient delirious (CAM+)?

🗆 Review med list for any deliriogenic medications and
discontinue/change where possible

🗆 Define RASS goal

🗆 Record QTc daily, consider changing medications if QTc \> 500

**Restraints**

🗆 Ask: Are restraints needed?

🗆 Sign necessary restraint orders

🗆 Discuss barriers to removing restraint orders

**Mobility**

🗆 Consult PT for early mobility

\- Contraindications include: deep sedation, paralysis

**Pressure Ulcers**

🗆 Ask: Are pressure ulcers present? Is a wound care consult needed?

🗆 Discuss whether any changes are needed to ulcer management plan

**DVT prophylaxis**

🗆 Review patient's current DVT prophylaxis orders and adjust if needed

\- Contraindications to LMWH DVT ppx include AKI (switch to UFH TID),
clinically significant bleeding (hold pharmacologic), platelet count \<
30K (hold pharmacologic)

\- Add sequential compression boots if holding pharmacologic prophylaxis

**GI / Nutrition**

🗆 Famotidine 20mg IV BID in intubated patients; Pantoprazole 20-40mg IV
daily if history of GERD or GI bleed

🗆 Review nutrition, consult nutrition if not already done. While
awaiting nutrition input, start enteral nutrition:

\- In most patients, Osmolite 1.5 \@10mL/hr, advance by 20mL Q6h to goal
50mL/hr

\- If renal failure and high K or phos: Nepro @ 10mL/hr, advance by 10mL
Q6h to goal 40mL/hr

\- MVI with minerals daily

\- thiamine 100mg daily x3 days

\- folate 1mg daily x 3 days

🗆 Ask: Is bowel regimen adequate? Make changes if necessary.

🗆 Review glucose range over past 48h and insulin regimen, adjust regimen
if needed.

\- Goal glucose range is 70-180

**Tubes / Lines / Drains**

🗆 List all tubes / lines / drains and discuss if any can be removed or
should be changed

**Patient / Family Communication**

🗆 Discuss if patient has healthcare making capacity - if not, activate
healthcare proxy

🗆 Update families by phone

\- Suggest RN update at least daily

\- MD update Q3 days, with any significant clinical change, or per
family request

**Disposition**

🗆 Discuss anticipated dispo, barriers to dispo

**Code Status**

🗆 Review current code status, discuss if goals of care are realistic
with prognosis - if not, discuss with patient / family

Abbreviations:

SAT = Spontaneous Awakening Trial

SBT = Spontaneous Breathing Trial

CAM = Confusion Assessment Method

RASS = Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale
