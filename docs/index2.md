Updated: 3/24/2020

**This document is a work in progress.**

**This is updated daily with evolving information; do not print.**

[SCCM
Guidelines](https://sccm.org/getattachment/Disaster/SSC-COVID19-Critical-Care-Guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US&_zs=WSjjd1&_zl=j1cc6) **are
being reviewed and incorporated but are not yet reflected in this
document**

**Please send suggestions:** <skornweiss@srhs.com>

**Disclaimer:** This document is intended as a resource for clinicians
caring for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, based on available evidence
and recommendations of governing bodies. The recommendations do not
replace clinical judgment or the need for individualized patient care
plans. While we attempt to keep this document up-to-date, the literature
on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and we suggest that practitioners
search for the most up-to-date literature on any specific topic. These
guidelines will also rapidly evolve as they are implemented into
clinical practice and we receive feedback from practitioners. Finally,
these guidelines were developed based on practice patterns and
infrastructure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA; and subsequently adapted for Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.

Checklist](#addendum-covid-icu-bundle-checklist)

# Chapter 1: Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers

1.  **Clinical Course of COVID-19**
    1.  **Clinical presentation:** non-specific, flu-like illness
        1.  Fever (44-98%)
        2.  Cough (46-82%)
        3.  Shortness of breath (20-64%)
        4.  Upper respiratory symptoms, nasal / sinus congestion (5-25%)
        5.  GI symptoms (10%; usually before respiratory symptoms)
    2.  **Transmission:**
        1.  Large droplets and fomites
            
            1.    - Viral particles survive < 24h on cardboard, < 72h
                    on  
                    plastic or steel ([van Dorelmalen et al, New Engl J
                    Med,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32182409))
        
        2.  Aerosols (droplet nuclei, < 5 µm), estimated < 4h
        
        3.    - Incubation period: median 4 days, common range 2-7 days,
                up  
                to 24 days
        
        4.  Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus
    3.  **Disease Course**:
        1.  ~ 80% do not require critical care
        
        2.  ~ 10-20% develop bacterial superinfection
        
        3.    - ~ 2-25% have respiratory viral co-infection (Qingdao,
                China:  
                [Xing et al, medRxiv, 2020
                preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2);
                Stanford, CA, USA: [Shah N, Medium, 2020 unpublished
                data](https://medium.com/@nigam/higher-co-infection-rates-in-covid19-b24965088333))
        
        4.  ~ 20% develop ARDS
        
        5.  ~ 5% develop renal injury requiring renal replacement
            therapy
        
        6.    - Elevated AST / ALT (~200s) is common; fulminant
                hepatitis not  
                reported
        
        7.    - Cardiomyopathy in critically ill patients; some progress
                to  
                cardiogenic shock late in course (anecdotal reports)
    4.  **Reasons for ICU admission:**
        1.    - Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common
                indication  
                for ICU.
            
            1.  Reports of rapid progression to intubation within 12-24h
        
        2.  Few patients with shock, can develop late in course
        
        3.  Median time from symptom onset to ICU transfer is ~10 days
    5.  **Poor prognostic indicators:**
        1.  Demographics: Age > 65, male
        
        2.    - Comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (includes  
                hypertension), pulmonary disease, diabetes, malignancy,
                immunosuppression
        
        3.    - Lab findings: severe lymphopenia, elevated troponin,
                elevated  
                creatinine, elevated LDH, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer
    6.  **Cause of death:**
        1.  ~53% respiratory failure
        
        2.  ~33% concomitant respiratory and heart failure
        
        3.  ~7% cardiac or heart failure alone
        
        4.    - Mortality rate appears to correlate with age and
                availability  
                of medical resources ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))
2.  **Infection Control**
    1.  **Personal Protective Equipment**
        1.    - This is an area that is actively changing. Guidance
                depends on  
                the specific unit, patient risk profile, and nature of
                contact
            
              - 1. [Partners PPE

                    soon  
                    (Partners sign-in required)
3.  **Inpatient (non-ICU) Management Principles**
    1.  **COVID testing**
        
        1.    - This is an area that is actively changing and varies
                widely by  
                hospital, test availability, and local epidemiology
            
              - 1. [Partners criteria available

                (Partners sign-in required)
    
    2.  **Diagnostic studies:**
        
        1.  Labs & EKG:
            
            1.    - On admission: CBC with differential, BMP, LFTs, LDH,
                    CRP,  
                    D-dimer, Troponin / CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin,
                    baseline EKG
            
            2.  Daily: CBC with differential, BMP
                
                1.  For stable floor patients, consider every other day
            
            3.    - Every other day: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin /
                    CPK  
                    (if in ICU), Triglycerides (if on propofol)
            
            4.    - If clinical worsening: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer,
                    Troponin,  
                    CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin, Ferritin, Fibrinogen,
                    EKG
            
            5.  Expert opinion does not recommend routine pro-BNP.
        
        2.    - Chest imaging: Portable CXR is sufficient in most
                cases.  
                Avoid routine daily CXR (unlikely to change management,
                evaluate case-by-case).
            
              - 1. Chest imaging variable; bilateral patchy opacities
                most  
                common
            
              - 2. Chest CT often will not change treatment; obtain
                only if  
                necessary (risk of transmission, time associated with
                transport / decontamination of equipment)
            
              - 3. Point of Care Ultrasound of the lungs can be used
                but by  
                experienced providers only
        
        3.  Obtain additional studies only if necessary
            
            1.  Avoid routine TTEs (for cardiac studies, see: [“Cardiac
                Complications of COVID”
                chapter](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19)).
    
    3.  **Medical management:**
        
        1.  Further details in [“COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials”
            chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)
        
        2.  Management is largely supportive
        
        3.    - Fluid management should be conservative due to risk of  
                hypoxia/CHF
        
        4.  Antiviral and immune-modulating therapies are
            investigational
    
    4.  **Early Advance Care Planning:**
        
        1.  In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form
        2.  Discuss and document goals of care on admission
            1.  Educate patient and family on disease course
            
            2.    - Focus on desired quality of life and tolerance for
                    ICU  
                    measures
                
                  - a. Avoid implying availability of ICU measures if
                    unknown  
                    (refer to local ethics guidance)
    
    5.    - **Avoid increasing risk of transmission:** Generally avoid  
            transport if possible.
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
        1.  Further details in [“COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials”
            chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)
        
        2.    - Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV:
                BiPAP,  
                CPAP), High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), Humidified
                Venturi Face Masks, Nebulizers increase aerosolization.
            
              - 1. Any aerosol-generating intervention must be
                performed under  
                Strict (Airborne) Isolation Precautions, in a negative
                pressure room.
            
              - 2. In current policy, patients with severe OSA may
                continue  
                nocturnal CPAP / BiPAP but must use a BWH NIPPV mask and
                machine, not their home mask or nasal pillows which have
                elevated aerosol risk. BWH machines have dual limb (with
                HEPA filter); in contrast, home machines have a single
                limb so they have an anti-asphyxiation (pop-off) valve
                that increases aerosol risk.
                
                1.  Transition back to home machine if COVID-19 ruled
                    out
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Use metered dose inhalers instead of nebulizers.
                
                1.  Transition back to nebs if COVID-19 ruled out
            
            2.    - If patient already on BiPAP / CPAP / HFNC becomes  
                    COVID-suspected, transition to non-rebreather
                    followed by intubation.
            
            3.    - NIPPV* is not used for ARDS; early intubation is  
                    preferred.

<!-- end list -->

1.    - Similar to many U.S. medical centers, our current default is to
        avoid  
        HFNC in DNI patients and to use NRB, although exceptions can be
        considered on a case-by-case basis.

2.  **Chest Imaging and Point of Care Lung Ultrasound**
    
    1.  *This section is in progress*

3.  **Triage to ICU**
    
    1.  **Consult the ICU triage team EARLY for:**
        1.  Provider concern
        
        2.  Respiratory distress
            
            1.  Need O2 > 6 LPM to maintain SpO2 > 92 or PaO2 > 65.
            2.  Rapid escalation of oxygen requirement.
            3.  Significant work of breathing.
        
        3.    - Hemodynamic instability after initial conservative
                fluid  
                resuscitation
            
              - 1. SBP < 90, Mean arterial pressure < 65, or Heart
                rate >  
                120.
        
        4.  Acidosis
            
            1.    - ABG with pH < 7.3 or PCO2 > 50 or above
                    patient’s  
                    baseline.
            
            2.  Lactate > 2.
        
        5.    - Need for intensive nursing care or frequent laboratory
                draws  
                requiring arterial line.
        
        6.  Severe comorbid illness / high risk for deterioration.

4.  **Transfer Process**
    
    1.  **Additional details in Strict Isolation Procedures Manual.**
    2.  **Floor / ED to ICU:**
        1.    - ICU RN brings ICU bed to the floor for transfer (to
                avoid bed  
                transfer in COVID precautions room and subsequent bed
                cleaning).
        
        2.    - Patient wears surgical mask, with an extra clean gown
                and  
                sheet on top.
        
        3.  Providers wear standard PPE during transport.
        
        4.    - Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer
                route,  
                walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required
                to wear PPE
        
        5.    - Necessary tests (*e.g.* CT), should be obtained during  
                transfer if possible.
    3.  **ICU to floor:**
        1.  RN wears standard PPE
        
        2.  Patient travels in wheelchair or stretcher
        
        3.    - Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer
                route,  
                walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required
                to wear PPE
    4.  **Floor to discharge: see separate documentation of discharge
        criteria/planning**
        1.  RN wears standard PPE
        
        2.  Patient travels in wheelchair
        
        3.    - Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer
                route,  
                walks 6 ft away from patient and providers, not required
                to wear PPE
        
        4.    - Patient is escorted directly into vehicle; contact
                care  
                management if patient does not have access to a personal
                vehicle

# Chapter 2: Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients

1.  **Respiratory Failure and ARDS**
    1.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - Histology shows bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with  
                cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of
                pneumocytes, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane
                formation ([Xu et al, Lancet Respir Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085846))
        
        2.    - Some evidence of direct viral injury to lung tissue,
                rather  
                than purely hyperinflammatory process ([Xu et al, Lancet
                Respir Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085846))
    2.  **Time course:**
        1.    - Anecdotal reports that progression of hypoxemic
                respiratory  
                failure occurs rapidly (within ~12-24 hours)
        
        2.  From onset of symptoms, median time to:
            
            1.    - Development of ARDS: 8-12 days ([Wang et al, JAMA,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);  
                    [Zhou et al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076);
                    [Huang et al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264))
            
            2.    - Mechanical ventilation: 10.5-14.5 days ([Huang et
                    al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264);  
                    [Zhou et al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076))
2.  **Management of Hypoxemia**
    1.  **Supplemental Oxygen:**
        1.    - Humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1 to 8 LPM for target
                SpO2  
                92-96%
        
        2.    - If a patient requires > 8 LPM NC, initiate dry Venturi
                mask  
                (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk)
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Start Venturi mask at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%
            
            2.    - Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not
                    exceeding FiO2  
                    35%)
            
            3.  If FiO2 > 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM
        
        3.  Notify ICU triage pager
    2.  **Avoid high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive
        pressure ventilation (NIPPV; i.e. CPAP/BiPAP) for ARDS.**
        1.    - Patients on nocturnal NIPPV at home should continue
                their  
                nocturnal NIPPV. However, patient must use BWH NIPPV
                mask and machine (not home mask/nasal pillow or machine
                due to increased aerosol risk with home
                pillows/mask/machine) under strict airborne precautions.
        
        2.    - If a patient already on HFNC or NIPPV becomes a COVID-19
                PUI,  
                transition to non-rebreather if safe
            
              - 1. Recommend that the patient be off an aerosol
                generating  
                device like HFNC or NIPPV for 45 minutes prior to
                intubation if clinically feasible
        
        3.    - If a patient is DNR/DNI or otherwise is not eligible
                for  
                intubation:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  **Current policy advises avoiding HFNC or NIPPV in
                DNI/DNR patients. However, neither HFNC nor NIPPV is
                prohibited and case-by-case exceptions could apply.**
            
            2.    - This is an evolving area without definitive evidence
                    or  
                    uniform policy that underwent multi-disciplinary
                    discussion.
            
            3.  Considerations include:

<!-- end list -->

  - Safety of staff (particularly respiratory therapy and nursing);

  - Paucity of data on the increased aerosol risk;

  -   - [WHO interim guidance (published March 13,
        2020)](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)  
        on COVID-19 are more liberal about the usage of HFNC and NIPPV,
        stating that systems with “good interface fitting [i.e., good
        seal, no air leak] do not create widespread dispersion of
        exhaled air and therefore should be associated with low risk of
        airborne transmission.”

  -   - Difficulty in assessing how many patients failing NRB would
        survive  
        on HFNC.

  - Pro-active treatment of air hunger through other means.

  -   - HFNC has been utilized in lieu of ventilation of both full code
        and  
        DNI/DNR patients in the setting of limited resources.

<!-- end list -->

1.    - For HFNC, recommend patient wear surgical mask and limit flow
        rate to  
        < 30 L/min

2.  For BiPAP, use an in-line viral filter.

3.    - Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is minimal air leak (as
        leaks  
        propel potentially infected air significant distances - see
        “Rationale” below)

4.    - *Rationale*: General consensus suggests that HFNC and NIPPV
        increase  
        the risk of viral transmission. Given the rapid progression of
        disease, we do not expect many patients can be salvaged/avoid
        intubation using HFNC/NIPPV, but this is unknown
    
      - 1. A systematic review on SARS found that NIPPV was associated
        with  
        increased risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers (n=2
        studies), but HFNC was not (n=1) ([Tran et al, PLoS One,
        2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563403))
    
      - 2. Other studies with very limited power exist, such as a
        post-hoc  
        analysis that found no secondary infections in medical staff
        from patients with influenza H1N1 treated with HFNC but was
        limited to only n=20 ([Rello et
        al,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762937) [J Crit Care,
        2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762937));
    
      - 3. Exhaled air distances are minimally increased with CPAP
        pressures  
        up to 20 cm H2O and HFNC up to 60 LPM; device/interface leaks
        cause significant lateral air travel ([Hui et al, Eur Respir J,
        2019](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705129))

5.  **Early intubation:**
    
    1.    - We recommend early consultation with anesthesia for
            possible  
            intubation in the setting of rapidly progressive hypoxia.
        
          - 1. Case reports from China suggest high failure rates for  
            non-invasive ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen
            ([Zuo et al, Chin Med Sci J,
            2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102726))
    
    2.    - For patients maintained on Venturi mask, once FiO2 = 60%
            and  
            SpO2 < 92%, call for intubation if patient is a candidate
            for mechanical ventilation
        
          - 1. There is a COVID Airway Code Team with specific
            protocols for  
            avoiding aerosolization.
        
          - 2. Many centers suggest Rapid Sequence Intubation when
            fully  
            paralyzed, without ambu-bag (which generates aerosols) and
            highly experienced operators (*e.g.*, anesthesia attending).
    
    3.    - Consider additional indications for intubation (tachypnea,
            work  
            of breathing).

<!-- end list -->

3.  **Initial Mechanical Ventilation**
    1.  **Intubations outside of ICU:**
        1.    - Should be attended by the Resource RT, who can
                facilitate  
                early and appropriate ventilator settings with
                non-intensivists.
        
        2.  Use “Mechanical Ventilation with Sedation” orderset.
    2.  **Initiate Volume Control (AC/VC) mode**
    3.  **Initial tidal volume (Vt):**
        1.    - Vt = 6 ml/kg (based on ideal body weight [IBW] from
                ARDSnet  
                table, see table below)
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  IBW men (kg) = 50 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)
            2.  IBW women (kg) = 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)

<!-- end list -->

4.  **Initial respiratory rate 16-24, higher if acidosis present.**
5.  **Initial PEEP based on BMI:**
    1.  BMI < 35: PEEP 10
    2.  BMI 35 to 50: PEEP 12
    3.  BMI > 50: PEEP 15
6.  **Initial FiO2:**
    1.  100% on intubation then rapidly wean to SpO2 92-96% ([Barrot et
        al, N Engl J Med,
        2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661))
7.  **Obtain STAT portable CXR to confirm endotracheal tube location:**
    1.  Order and page radiology at time of intubation
    
    2.    - Prioritize CXR and vent titration over procedures (such as  
            central venous catheter placement) if possible.
8.  **Within 30 minutes of intubation, obtain an ABG (preferred) or a
    VBG and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed**

<!-- end list -->

4.  **PEEP and Mechanics**
    1.  **If patients supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator (most common),
        perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation:**
        1.    - Determine best PEEP following intubation while
                paralyzed  
                using Pressure-Volume (PV) tool
            
              - 1. This is a departure from use of Best PEEP Trials. PV
                tool  
                is the preferred method due to widespread familiarity
                with RT staff, institutional experience, time
                constraints, and minimizing provider exposure
        
        2.    - Recommend maintaining this PEEP for initial care
                unless  
                titration is required based on clinical parameters
                (*e.g.*, hypoxia, elevated Ppl, etc)
        
        3.    - If PEEP titration is required based on change in
                clinical  
                status, recommend using PV tool to assess new PEEP. If
                this is not possible (no knowledgeable user available or
                patient inadequately sedated) then recommend PEEP
                titration by the Lower PEEP ARDSnet table (see below)
    2.  **If patients not supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator, perform
        the following within 10 minutes of intubation**:
        1.  Initiate PEEP based on BMI
        
        2.    - If there are changes in clinical parameters (*e.g.,*  
                hypoxia), titrate PEEP according to ARDSnet Lower PEEP
                table (below).
        
        3.    - Current recommendations are to use ARDSnet Lower PEEP
                table.  
                This table is selected primarily to avoid doing initial
                harm to patients with poor lung compliance and was
                chosen following joint MGH and BWH
                discussion.![image2](.//media/image2.png)
    3.  **After best PEEP determined, obtain** **respiratory
        mechanics**:
        1.  Plateau pressure (with goal < 30, management below)
        2.  Static compliance
    4.  **Obtain arterial blood gas:**
        1.  Goal pH 7.25 to 7.45
        2.  Calculate P/F ratio from initial post-intubation ABG
    5.  **Routine esophageal balloon use is not recommended**
5.  **Targeting Sedation for Ventilator Synchrony**
    1.  **Initially target RASS -2 to -3 (see table below):**
        
        1.    - Maintain deep sedation immediately post-intubation
                while  
                paralyzed (assume 60 minutes for Rocuronium, 10 minutes
                for succinylcholine)
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Preferred initial sedation regimen:
                1.    - Fentanyl/Hydromorphone (boluses +/- infusion) +
                        Propofol:  
                        target analgosedation and optimize analgesia
                        first while decreasing sedative requirements
                
                2.    - Measure triglycerides and lipase every third day
                        on  
                        propofol or earlier if other reasons for
                        hypertriglyceridemia
            2.  Adjunct agent: Midazolam
            3.  Use dexmedetomidine only when nearing extubation
    
    2.    - **Target ventilator synchrony:** Ventilator-induced lung
            injury  
            (VILI) is common in patients who are not synchronous with
            the ventilator and can cause significant lasting damage
        
          - i. Once at target RASS after paralytics have worn off,
            assess  
            patient synchrony with the ventilator (*e.g.*, signs of
            breath-stacking, double triggering, other ventilator
            alarms).
            
            1.  Titrate sedatives/analgesics to ventilator synchrony
                allowing for deeper RASS.
            2.  If patient remains dyssynchronous despite deep sedation
                (RASS -5), initiate continuous paralytics (ensure BIS 40
                to 60 prior to initiating and during paralysis).

<!-- end list -->

6.  **General Management of Ventilated ARDS Patients**
    1.  **Consider whether patient requires daily CXR:**
        1.  CXR clearly indicated for:
            1.  Clinical change
            2.  Concern for displaced ET tube:
                1.    - Sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure
                        or  
                        resistance
                
                2.    - Decreased, unilateral breath sounds (usually on
                        the  
                        right)
                
                3.  RN or RT concern for change in depth of ET tube at
                    teeth
    2.  **COVID-19 ICU Bundle:**
        1.    - Ventilated patients should all have a daily ICU “Bundle”
                of  
                best practices. See [Addendum
                1](#addendum-covid-icu-bundle-checklist) for a proposed
                “COVID-19 ICU Bundle”.
    3.  **Ventilator consults:**
        1.    - If you need additional assistance managing ventilator
                choices,  
                you can request a pulmonary phone/in-person consult
                (pager 11957).
7.  **Managing Ventilation**
    1.  **Follow ARDSnet ventilation where possible:**
        1.    - Tidal volumes should be 4-6 cc/kg using IBW (see table
                above)  
                to minimize volumes (and thus ventilator injury).
    2.  **Minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume) typically
        drives pH and PCO2:**
        1.  Titrate ventilatory parameters to pH, not PCO2.
        
        2.    - To achieve low tidal volumes, we tolerate hypercapnia  
                (functionally no limitation unless clinical sequelae)
                and acidemia (pH > 7.2).
        
        3.    - Because tidal volumes are low, the respiratory rate
                often  
                has to be high to accommodate; typical RR is 20-35
                breaths/minute.
    3.  **pH goal is normally 7.25-7.45:**
        1.  If pH > 7.45, decrease respiratory rate
        
        2.    - If pH 7.15-7.30, then increase respiratory rate until pH
                >  
                7.30, or PaCO2 < 25 (maximum RR= 35 breaths/minute)
        
        3.    - If pH < 7.15, then increase respiratory rate to 35  
                breaths/minute
        
        4.  If pH still < 7.15, then perform the following:
            
            1.    - Tidal volume may be increased by 1 mL/kg until pH >
                    7.15  
                    (until plateau pressure reaches 30 cm H2O or tidal
                    volume reaches 8 cc/kg)
            
            2.  Deep sedation advancing to RASS -5 if needed
            
            3.  If no improvement, initiate continuous paralysis
            
            4.    - If still no improvement, initiate prone ventilation
                    (may  
                    improve V/Q matching and better ventilation)
8.  **Managing Oxygenation**
    1.  **Minimizing oxygen toxicity:**
        1.  PEEP and Fi02 drive oxygenation
        
        2.    - The goal is to deliver a partial pressure of oxygen to  
                perfuse tissues (PaO2 > 75, Sp02 >92%) while limiting
                lung injury from high distending pressures (Ppl < 30)
                and hyperoxia (**FiO2 < 75**, SpO2 < 96%).
        
        3.    - Lower limit goals for PaO2 / SpO2 are widely debated
                (and  
                discussed in *Rationale*); PaO2 > 55 and SpO2 >88% are
                also commonly used at BWH.
    2.  **PEEP management:**
        1.  Initial PEEP should be set as explained in section 4 above.
        
        2.    - If patient is hypoxic on Vt = 6 ml/kg and ideal PEEP
                from PV  
                tool (or PEEP determination from ARDSnet table for
                non-Hamilton G5 ventilators), perform the following:
            
              - 1. Deep sedation, advancing to RASS -5 if needed; if
                no  
                improvement then:
            
              - 2. Initiate continuous paralysis (cisatracurium bolus  
                0.2mg/kg followed by infusion at 0-5 mcg/kg/min titrated
                to patient-ventilator synchrony); if no improvement
                then:
            
              - 3. Initiate prone ventilation (see below); high
                consideration  
                for use early in severe ARDS (<36 hours from ARDS
                onset, start discussion of proning when P:F < 150,
                prone within 12 hours of FiO2 > 75%)
    3.  **Checking plateau pressure:**
        1.    - Check plateau pressure with every change in tidal
                volume,  
                PEEP, or clinical deterioration (worsening oxygenation)
                but not as part of routine practice
            
              - 1. If plateau pressure is > 30 cm H20, then decrease
                tidal  
                volume by 1 ml/kg (minimum 4 mL/kg)
            
              - 2. If plateau pressure is < 25 H20 and tidal volume <
                6 mL/kg,  
                then increase tidal volume by 1 mL/kg until plateau
                pressure is > 25 cm H2O or tidal volume = 6 mL/kg
            
              - 3. If plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20 and patient is
                breath  
                stacking or dyssynchronous, then increase tidal volume
                in mL/kg increments to 7 mL/kg or 8 mL/kg so long as
                plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20
    4.  **Adjusting Fi02:**
        1.  Adjust Fi02 after optimizing PEEP
        
        2.    - Goal FiO2 < 75%; if FiO2 > 75%; patient requires
                ventilator  
                optimization. If you need assistance, pulmonary
                consultation is available (pager 11957)
        
        3.    - It is reasonable to put a desaturating patient
                temporarily  
                on 100% Fi02, but remember to wean oxygen as rapidly as
                possible
    5.  **Rationale**:
        1.    - *Avoiding hyperoxia:* Extensive mammalian animal data  
                demonstrates that hyperoxic injury occurs at an FiO2 ≥
                75% (at sea level) with the rate of injury increasing as
                FiO2 exceeds that threshold. In multiple mammalian
                models, an FiO2 of 100% for 48 to 72 hours is associated
                with nearly 100% mortality rate. In lung injury models,
                the time to death is markedly attenuated. In an effort
                to reduce the potential for hyperoxic injury, the
                threshold of FiO2 ≥ 75% triggers progressive
                intervention throughout this protocol: increased
                sedation, paralysis, proning and ECMO consultation. For
                a review of hyperoxic acute lung injury, see [Kallet and
                Matthay, Respir Care,
                2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271823).
        
        2.    - *Setting the lower oxygen limits:* There is debate on
                the  
                proper PaO2 goal, and our rationale relies on evidence
                for lack of benefit from conservative PaO2 goals in
                clinical trials (*i.e.*, PaO2 > 55) and past
                association between lower PaO2 and cognitive impairment,
                although the evidence is certainly not definitive (mean
                PaO2 71 [IQR 67-80] for cognitively impaired survivors
                versus mean PaO2 86 [IQR, 70-98] in non-impaired
                survivors of ARDS ([Mikkelsen et al, Am J Respir Crit
                Care Med,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492988)
                [2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492988)). In
                the LOCO<sub>2</sub> multi-center, randomized clinical
                trial, patients with ARDS were randomized to their PaO2
                55-70, SpO2 88-92%; or PaO2 90-105, SpO2 >95%); the
                trial was stopped after enrollment of 205 patients due
                to futility and safety concerns (44% mortality in
                conservative oxygen group versus 30%; ([Barrot et al,
                New Eng J
                Med,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661)
                [2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661)).
9.  **Proning and Pulmonary Vasodilators**
    1.  **Prone early:**
        1.    - We recommend early proning in severe ARDS without
                vasodilator  
                trial (a departure from our typical practice for ARDS
                not due to COVID-19): < 36 hours from ARDS onset, start
                discussion of prone when P:F < 150, prone within 12
                hours of FiO2 > 75% ([Guérin et al, N Engl J Med,
                2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23688302)).
    2.  **Eligibility criteria for proning:**
        1.    - Eligibility may vary depending on resources and
                staffing.  
                Currently we recommend:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Age < 75
            
            2.    - No high grade shock (either single agent
                    norepinephrine 20  
                    mcg/min or norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min and
                    vasopressin)
            
            3.    - Not on CRRT or at risk of impending renal failure
                    (due to  
                    difficulties in maintaining dialysis access while
                    proned)
            
            4.    - The only absolute contraindications to proned
                    ventilation  
                    are spinal cord injury and open chest; BMI and
                    patient size are not contraindications
    3.  **To initiate prone ventilation outside of MICU and 11C:**
        1.  Discuss with the PCCM Consultation team assigned to that
            unit
        
        2.    - ICU charge nurse to contact MICU charge nurse for
                nursing  
                assistance
    4.  **Managing a proned patient:**
        1.  Proning protocol is available at the MICU sharepoint
        
        2.    - Maintain deep sedation with target RASS -4 to -5 while  
                proned.
        
        3.  1 hour post-initiation of prone ventilation:
            
            1.    - Adjust oxygen parameters: re-assess lung mechanics  
                    (plateau pressure and P-V tool to determine optimal
                    PEEP) and adjust PEEP and titrate FiO2 as in
                    [“Managing Ventilation”
                    section](#managing-ventilation) of this chapter.
            
            2.    - Assess tidal volume and adjust ventilation
                    parameters as  
                    in section 6
                
                  - a. If Vt < 6 ml/kg, may increase to maximum limit
                    of 8  
                    ml/kg while Ppl < 30 (preferred maximum is 6 ml/kg)
        
        4.    - If patient demonstrates improvement on proning then  
                recommend:
            
              - 1. Discontinuing of continuous neuromuscular blockade
                and  
                re-assess ventilator dyssynchrony; re-institute if
                dyssynchronous
            
              - 2. Return to supine ventilation when following criteria
                are  
                met:
                
                1.  Ppl < 25
                2.  FiO2 < 50%
                3.  pH > 7.3
                4.  P:F > 200
        
        5.  Repositioning and skin care while proned:
            
            1.    - Currently we recommend continuing proning as per the
                    MICU  
                    proning protocol. This may change in the future
                    depending on availability of PPE and staffing.
    5.  **Escalation if still hypoxic:**
        1.    - If hypoxia (PaO2 < 55 with FiO2 > 75%) persists
                after  
                proning; then initiate continuous inhaled epoprostenol
                (see [“COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials”
                chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)).
        
        2.    - If FiO2 > 75% despite above, recommend consultation
                with ECMO  
                team (see [“ECMO consultation”
                section](#ecmo-consultation) of this chapter).
10. **ECMO consultation**
    1.  **Refractory Hypoxemia:**
        1.    - If despite PEEP optimization, paralysis, prone
                ventilation,  
                optimizing volume status, pulmonary vasodilators (when
                available) the patient meets the following criteria,
                then consider ECMO consult (pager 35010):
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Ppl > 30
            2.  FiO2 > 75%
            3.  P:F < 80
    2.  **Candidacy:**
        1.    - Final ECMO guidelines for COVID-19 patients remain
                under  
                development. Examples of common considerations include:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Patient age < 65
            
            2.  Mechanical ventilation duration < 7 days
            
            3.  BMI < 35 and patient body weight < 150 kg
            
            4.  CrCl > 30
            
            5.    - No multiorgan failure or high grade shock (can be
                    on  
                    single pressor; norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min)
            
            6.  No active solid or liquid malignancy
            
            7.  Absolute neutrophil count > 500
            
            8.  Platelets > 50,000
            
            9.    - Able to tolerate anticoagulation on initiation (no
                    active  
                    hemorrhage)
            
            10. No evidence of irreversible neurological injury
            
            11. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

# Chapter 3: COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials

1.  **Note:**
    1.  *The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory section below written by
        our critical care group is meant to provide a summary of the
        literature. This section does not represent the views or
        recommendations of the BWH Division of Infectious Disease. The
        separate BWH Infectious Disease guidelines and ID consultation
        service take precedence over the information from the literature
        below.*
2.  **Clinical trials**
    1.  **Consult Infectious Disease for:**
        1.    - Patients with +COVID-19 PCR; and clinical history and
                any  
                chest imaging suspicious for COVID-19.
        
        2.    - Re-consult if the patient develops ARDS (mechanically  
                ventilated with P/F ratio < 300) or shock/cytokine
                syndrome.
    2.  **Current trials:**
        1.    - ID teams are enrolling for clinical trials of Remdesivir
                and  
                possibly other antiviral agents.
        
        2.    - ID and the PETAL network are coordinating to enroll
                for  
                clinical trials of host-response modifying therapies
                (see [“Systemic
                Corticosteroids”](#systemic-corticosteroids) and
                [“Anti-IL6
                agents”](#anti-il6-agents-tocilizumab-siltuximab)
                sections of this chapter).
    3.  **Monitor for drug-drug interactions:**
        1.    - Patients may arrive at the ICU already enrolled in a
                COVID-19  
                clinical trial. Verify that ICU treatment regimen does
                not add harmful drug interactions with study agents.
3.  **Antibiotic stewardship**
    1.  **Antibiotic choice:**
        
        1.    - Antibiotics should reflect IDSA guidelines, presumed
                source,  
                and MDRO risk. For a presumed pulmonary source:
            
              - 1. Without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e.
                living  
                in community, no prior MDROs):
                
                1.  Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin
            
              - 2. With risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e.
                chronic  
                hospitalization, prior MDR infections):
                
                1.  Vancomycin + Cefepime, and consider Ciprofloxacin if
                    high concern for Pseudomonas
            
              - 3. See special dispensations for oncology patients in  
                [“Considerations for Oncology Patients”
                section](#considerations-for-oncology-patients) within
                [“Other Guidance” chapter](#chapter-8-other-guidance).
    
    2.  **Formulation:**
        
        1.    - Give oral antibiotics (Azithromycin, Levofloxacin,  
                Ciprofloxacin) when possible to reduce volume load,
                unless concerns for poor oral absorption
    
    3.  **Coinfection:**
        
        1.  If concurrent influenza give Oseltamivir
        2.  Given lymphopenia consider Pneumocystis and treat
            accordingly
    
    4.  **Discontinuation:**
        
        1.    - Antibiotics should be discontinued as soon as possible
                (within  
                48h) if:
            
              - 1. Clinical status is not deteriorating, cultures do
                not  
                reveal pathogens at 48h, and procalcitonin and WBC are
                relatively stable from 0 to 48h
                
                1.  Clinical judgement should prevail over any specific
                    lab value
    
    5.    - **Rationale:** Clinical reports indicate that rates of
            bacterial  
            superinfection of COVID19 are low (10-20%), but when present
            increase mortality risk. Anecdotal reports suggest less MRSA
            superinfection than with influenza. Unnecessary antibiotics
            carry risks of fluid overload and drug-resistance, as well
            as the possibility that antibiotics may become a limited
            resource. ([Zhou et al, Lancet,

    1.  **Non-intubated patients:**
        
        1.    - For COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI, use MDI (inhalers), not  
                nebulizers, due to the increased aerosol risk.
        
        2.  Because MDI supply is limited, only prescribe when needed.
        
        3.    - For non-COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI patient, use
                nebulizers  
                even if on droplet precautions (*e.g.,* influenza)
                because MDI supply is limited.
        
        4.    - After a patient is COVID-neg (and no longer on COVID  
                precautions per infection control): After the patient’s
                current MDI runs out, switch to neb.
    
    2.  **Intubated patients:**
        
        1.    - The ventilator circuit is a closed system so nebulizers
                can be  
                used when required (*e.g.,* DuoNeb standing and
                albuterol PRN).
    
    3.    - **Rationale:** Nebulization may aerosolize viral particles
            and  
            contribute to disease transmission. COVID-19 clinical
            reports do not indicate wheeze as a common symptom, and not
            all patients require bronchodilators ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
            2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076); [Yang et
            al, Lancet

5.  **Airway Clearance**
    1.  **Management principles:**
        1.    - Reports from Wuhan and Italy indicate that some
                patients  
                develop very thick secretions causing dangerous mucus
                plugging. However, nebulizers and airway clearance
                techniques may aerosolize secretions
        
        2.    - Airway clearance should be used only in **selected
                ventilated patients (closed circuit)** with extremely
                thick  
                secretions to avoid mucus plugging that would require
                bronchoscopy
    2.  **For thinning secretions (in ventilated patients only):**
        1.  Nebulized treatment options:
            1.  Nebulized hypertonic (3-7%) saline once daily
                
                1.  Side effects can include bronchoconstriction
                    1.    - Start with 3% to assess response and  
                            bronchoconstriction
                    
                    2.    - Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg just prior
                            to  
                            delivery
            
            2.    - Alternatives include Dornase alfa 2.5mg nebulizer
                    once  
                    daily
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  Can cause bronchoconstriction and mucosal bleeding
                
                2.  Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg, just prior to
                    delivery
                
                3.  Avoid in setting of bloody secretions
                
                4.    - Anecdotal reports of efficacy in COVID-19,
                        however data  
                        for management of non-CF patients are poor. In
                        addition, Dornase is relatively costly.
            
            3.  Avoid N-acetylcysteine due to frequent dosing
                requirements
    3.  **Airway clearance:**
        1.    - Continue chest PT vests if patient uses at home (*e.g.,*
                CF  
                patients) with appropriate isolation precautions.
                Bronchiectasis patients may be considered on a
                case-by-case basis.
        
        2.    - Avoid oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices  
                (Aerobika or Acapella) and cough assist (MIE).
6.  **Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators**
    1.  **Indications for use:**
        1.    - Inhaled vasodilators should not be routinely used except
                in  
                two circumstances
            
              - 1. As a rescue strategy in already prone ventilated
                patients  
                (see [“Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients”
                chapter](#chapter-2-respiratory-support-for-covid-19-patients)).
                
                1.  There is no evidence of survival benefit of inhaled
                    vasodilators in ARDS, and there are risks of viral
                    aerosolization when connecting the device ([Fuller
                    et al, Chest,
                    2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742022);
                    [Gebistorf et al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev,

              - 2. To reduce RV afterload in hemodynamically
                significant RV  
                failure in consultation with cardiology
    2.  **Instructions for use:**
        1.    - If inhaled vasodilators are used, they should
                reevaluated at 4  
                hours
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Inhaled Epoprostenol:
                1.    - Start continuous nebulization at 0.05mcg/kg/min
                        based on  
                        IBW
                    
                      - i. If no improvement in P/F ratio in 2 hours,
                        wean off  
                        by decreasing 0.01mcg/kg/min every hour
            2.  Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):
                1.    - Strong consideration in refractory ARDS that
                        does not  
                        respond to inhaled epoprostenol.
                    
                      - i. Limited *in vitro* data notes that iNO at
                        high doses  
                        inhibits replication of SARS-CoV, but this has
                        not been studied *in vivo*. ([Akerstrom et al, J
                        Virol,
                        2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650225);
                        [Gebistorf et al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev,
                        2016](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347773))
                    
                      - ii. iNO may be included in future trial
                        protocols, such  
                        as early initiation in milder disease
                        (non-intubated).
7.  **Systemic Corticosteroids**
    1.  **Data on corticosteroids for COVID-19:**
        1.    - Most studies show negative effects of corticosteroids
                on  
                similar viruses
            
              - 1. There is no clinical evidence of net benefit from
                steroids  
                in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infection, and
                observational data show increased mortality, more
                secondary infections, impaired viral clearance and more
                adverse effects in survivors (*e.g.,* psychosis,
                diabetes, avascular necrosis) ([Lee et al, J Clin Virol,
                2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15494274);
                [Stockman et al, PLoS Med,
                2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968120);
                [Arabi et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med,
                2018](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161116);
                [WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance, March
                2020](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected);
                [Wu et al, JAMA Int Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).
        
        2.    - However, a new retrospective cohort (201 patients, 84
                [42%]  
                of whom developed ARDS) demonstrated that among patients
                with ARDS, methylprednisolone decreased risk of death
                (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72) ([Wu et al, JAMA Int Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).
    2.  **Recommendation**:
        1.  **We recommend against using steroids for COVID-19 except as
            part of a clinical trial**
            1.  This is in line with WHO guidance ([WHO, COVID-19
                Interim guidance, March
                2020](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).
    3.  **Use corticosteroids if required for other indications:**
        1.  Use the lowest dose for the shortest duration:
            1.  Asthma or COPD exacerbation
                
                1.    - 40mg prednisone PO or 30mg methylprednisolone
                        IV, once  
                        daily x 3-5 days
            
            2.    - Shock with history of chronic steroid use > 10mg
                    prednisone  
                    daily:
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in
                    shock
            
            3.  Multipressor shock without history of chronic steroid
                use
                
                1.  50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in
                    shock
8.  **Anti-IL6 Agents (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab)**
    1.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - IL-6 activates T cells and macrophages, among other cell
                types  
                (see [“Cytokine Activation Syndrome”
                section](#cytokine-activation-syndrome) in [“Shock”
                chapter](#chapter-5-shock-septic-cardiogenic-and-cytokine-storm)).
            
              - 1. IL-6 inhibitors are approved for cytokine
                activation  
                syndrome complications related to Chimeric Antigen
                Receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy ([Brudno and
                Kochenderfer, Blood Rev,
                2019](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528964);
                [Rubin et al, Brain,
                2019](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891590)).
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  IL-6 levels are reported to correlate with severe
                COVID-19
            
            3.    - While patients have peripheral lymphopenia, BAL
                    fluid is  
                    often lymphocytic, suggesting that IL-6 inhibition
                    and prevention of T cell activation may be
                    protective.
    2.  **Recommendation:**
        1.  We do not recommend routine use at this time
            1.    - There are anecdotal reports of benefit of
                    tocilizumab in  
                    COVID-19 patients but no rigorous studies are
                    available (Anecdotal reports from Italy; [National
                    Health Commission & State Administration of
                    Traditional Chinese Medicine, Diagnosis and
                    Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus
                    Pneumonia](http://busan.china-consulate.org/chn/zt/4/P020200310548447287942.pdf)
                    [[Trial Version 7], March
                    2020](http://busan.china-consulate.org/chn/zt/4/P020200310548447287942.pdf))
        2.  For severe cytokine activation syndrome cases (see [“Other
            Guidance” chapter](#chapter-8-other-guidance)):
            1.    - To be used in conjunction with Infectious Disease  
                    consultation in severe COVID-19 disease with
                    suspicion of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
                
                  - i. Retrospective reviews in patients with
                    rheumatological  
                    disease suggested a possible increase in serious
                    bacterial infection, so it may be reasonable to
                    exercise caution if secondary infection is
                    clinically suspected. However, tocilizumab is
                    routinely used at BWH (*e.g.*, CRS in patients after
                    CAR-T cell treatment) without obvious increase in
                    bacterial infection.
    3.  **Dosing regimens:**
        1.    - Tocilizumab 4-8mg/kg (suggested dose 400mg) IV x1
                (anti-IL6R  
                mAb)
            
              - 1. Dose can be repeated 12h later if inadequate
                response to  
                the first dose. Total dose should be no more than 800mg.
                Tocilizumab should not be administered more than twice.
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Common adverse effects include:
                1.  Transaminitis (AST, ALT) > 22%
                2.  Infusion reaction 4-20%
                3.  Hypercholesterolemia 20%
                4.  Upper respiratory tract infection 7%
                5.  Neutropenia 2-7%
        
        2.  Alternative: Siltuximab 11mg/kg IV x1 (anti-IL6 mAb)
            
            1.  Common adverse effects include:
                1.  Edema >26%
                2.  Upper respiratory infection >26%
                3.  Pruritus / skin rash 28%
                4.  Hyperuricemia 11%
                5.  Lower respiratory tract infection 8%
                6.  Thrombocytopenia 8%
                7.  Hypotension 4%
9.  **Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine**
    1.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) is an anti-malarial
                4-aminoquinoline  
                shown to have in vitro (but not yet in-vivo) activity
                against diverse RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-1
                ([Touret and de Lamballerie, Antivir Res,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32147496)).
        
        2.  HQ is thought to act through multiple mechanisms ([Devaux et
            al, Int J Antimicrob Agent,
            2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171740)):
            
            1.    - **Inhibition of viral entry.** HQ inhibits synthesis
                    of  
                    sialic acids and interferes with protein
                    glycosylation, which may disrupt interactions
                    necessary for viral attachment and entry ([Vincent
                    et](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115318)
                    [al, Virol J,
                    2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115318);

                    2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15766653)).
            
            2.    - **Inhibition of viral release into the host cell.**
                    HQ  
                    blocks endosomal acidification, which activates
                    endosomal proteases. These proteases are required to
                    initiate coronavirus/endosome fusion that releases
                    viral particles into the cell ([Yang et al, J Virol
                    2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140961)).
            
            3.    - **Reduction of viral infectivity.** HQ has been
                    shown to  
                    inhibit protein glycosylation and proteolytic
                    maturation of viral proteins. Studies on other RNA
                    viruses have shown a resulting accumulation of
                    non-infective viral particles, or an inability of
                    viral particles to bud out of the host cell
                    ([Savarino et al, J
                    Acquir](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15076236)
                    [Immune Defic
                    Syndr,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15076236)
                    [2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15076236);
                    [Klumperman et al, J Virol,
                    1994](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8083990)).
            
            4.    - **Immune modulation.** HQ reduces toll-like
                    receptors and  
                    cGAS-STING signaling. It has been shown to reduce
                    release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines
                    from several immune cell types ([Schrezenmeier and
                    Dorner, Nat Rev Rheum,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034323)).
    2.  **Data:**
        1.    - An expert consensus group out of China suggests that  
                Chloroquine improved lung imaging and shortened disease
                course ([Zhonghua et al, CMAPH,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075365)).
                Chloroquine will be included in the next treatment
                guidelines from the National Health Commission, but the
                specific data on which this is based is not available
                yet ([Gao et al, Biosci Trends,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550)).
        
        2.    - Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than  
                chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro ([Yao et
                al, Clin Infect Dis,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150618))
    3.  **Recommendation:**
        1.    - Strong consideration of hydroxychloroquine in patients
                who  
                require supplemental oxygen who are not candidates for
                other clinical trials.
    4.  **Dosing (from published literature):**
        1.  Hydroxychloroquine:
            1.    - 400mg PO BID on the first day, followed by 200mg q12
                    (q8h  
                    if concerns for absorption) for 5-10 days
        2.  Chloroquine (not available at BWH and no plans to start
            use):
            1.  500mg Chloroquine phosphate 500mg PO BID for 10 days
            
            2.    - Increased toxicity compared to hydroxychloroquine
                    with  
                    potential adverse effects including:
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  Prolonged QT interval and risk of Torsade de pointes
                2.  Cardiomyopathy
                3.  Bone marrow suppression
                4.  Contraindicated in epilepsy and porphyria
    5.  **Monitoring**
        1.    - If hydroxychloroquine is being administered with  
                azithromycin, there should be vigilant QTc monitoring:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Obtain baseline ECG and daily ECG
            
            2.  Discontinue all other QT prolonging agents
            
            3.  Maintain continuous telemetry while under treatment
            
            4.  Do not start if QTc >500 or 550 with pacing or BBB.
            
            5.    - Discontinue if there is an increase in PVCs or  
                    non-sustained PMVT.
        
        2.    - There is a reported risk of hydroxychloroquine induced  
                cardiomyopathy. Case series and reports have found this
                to be a long-term (years) and dose-dependent phenomenon.
                Given the anticipated short duration in COVID-19, it is
                not an expected risk ([Nord et al, Semin Arthritis
                Rheum,
                2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15079764)).
10. **Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin
    II Receptor Blockers (ARB)**
    1.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters the
                same  
                cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV: angiotensin converting
                enzyme II (ACE2) ([Paules et al, JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31971553)).
                SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have a higher affinity to ACE2
                than SARS-CoV.
            
              - 1. ACE2 is expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature,
                and  
                kidneys. ACEi and ARBs in animal models increase the
                expression of ACE2 ([Zheng et al, Nat Rev Cardiol,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32139904)),
                though this has not been confirmed in human studies.
                This has led to the hypothesis that ACE-I and ARBs,
                might worsen myocarditis or precipitate ACS.
            
              - 2. It has also been hypothesized that the upregulation
                of ACE2  
                is therapeutic in COVID-19 and that ARBs might be
                protective in during infection ([Gurwitz D, Drug Dev
                Res,
                2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32129518)).
    2.  **Recommendation:**
        1.  For outpatients:
            1.  We recommend against discontinuing outpatient ACEi/ARBs.
        2.  For inpatients:
            1.    - We recommend against routine discontinuation of  
                    ACEi/ARBs, unless otherwise indicated (*e.g.,* acute
                    kidney injury, hypotension, shock, etc).
        3.  Rationale
            1.    - The American College of Cardiology, American Heart  
                    Association and Heart Failure Society of America
                    joint statement recommends against discontinuing
                    ACE-I and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 ([Bozkurt
                    et al, HFSA/ACC/AHA Statement Addresses Concerns Re:
                    Using RAAS Antagonists in COVID-19,
                    2020](http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/17/08/59/hfsa-acc-aha-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-raas-antagonists-in-covid-19)).
                    This remains an area of investigation and it is
                    unclear how these medications affect patients with
                    COVID-19.
11. **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**
    1.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via ACE2. ACE2 is upregulated
                by  
                ibuprofen in animal models, and this might contribute
                (see [“Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I)
                and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)”
                section](#angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-ace-i-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers-arb)
                of this chapter).
    2.  **Recommendation:**
        1.    - Consider acetaminophen instead of NSAIDs if possible;
                risk /  
                benefit should be discussed with patients and treatment
                team.
            
              - 1. Reports from France indicate possible increase in
                mortality  
                with ibuprofen in COVID-19 infection, but these reports
                have not been corroborated ([Fang et al, Lancet Respir
                Med, 2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171062);
                [Day M, BMJ,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184201)).
            
              - 2. WHO clarified on 3/20/20 it does not recommend
                avoiding  
                NSAIDs as of 3/18/20 ([WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance,
                March
                2020](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).
12. **Blood Products**
    1.  **Recommendation:**
        
        1.    - Restrictive transfusion strategy (Hct > 21, Hgb > 7)
                is  
                recommended unless the patient is actively bleeding or
                there is concern for acute coronary syndrome.
            
              - 1. Parsimony is encouraged given limited supplies
                (blood  
                drives are limited by social distancing)
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Acute coronary syndrome: Hgb > 10
            
            3.  Oncology patients: if possible, reduce threshold to Hgb
                >7
            
            4.  All others: Hgb > 7
            
            5.    - Massive transfusion protocol, as a very limited
                    resource,  
                    will need to be activated only by the ICU attending
        
        2.  Other blood products:
            
            1.  Treat bleeding not numbers
            
            2.    - FFP or 4 factor-PCC (lower volume) for active
                    bleeding in  
                    setting of known or suspected coagulation
                    abnormalities
            
            3.    - Warfarin reversal: use 4 factor-PCC given longer
                    effect  
                    and lower volume
            
            4.  Platelets: goal > 30K unless actively bleeding
    
    2.    - **Rationale**: Volume overload is of particular concern in  
            patients with COVID-19 so transfusions may be harmful.
            Randomized controlled trials of ICU patients have shown that
            a conservative transfusion strategy (Hgb > 7) is associated
            with less pulmonary edema, fewer cardiac events, fewer
            transfusions (likely fewer transfusion reactions) and no
            evidence of harm compared to a liberal transfusion strategy.

# Chapter 4: Cardiac Complications of COVID-19

1.  **Acute Cardiac Injury**
    1.  **Definition:**
        1.    - Defined in studies as troponin > 99<sup>th</sup>
                percentile, or  
                abnormal EKG or echocardiographic findings ([Zhou et al,
                Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
                Non-specific.
    2.  **Incidence**:
        1.    - Incidence of 7-22% in hospitalized patients with
                COVID-19 in  
                China ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
                [Wang et al, JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);
                [Chen et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143)).
    3.  **Prognostic implications:**
        1.    - ACI is higher in non-survivors (59%, n=32) than
                survivors (1%,  
                n=1) ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
        
        2.    - ACI is higher in ICU patients (22%, n=22) compared to
                non-ICU  
                patients (2%, n=2) ([Wang et al, JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570))
    4.  **Time course:**
        1.    - Troponin rise and acute cardiac injury tend to be late  
                manifestations.
            
              - 1. Troponin increased rapidly from ~14 days from
                illness onset,  
                after the onset of respiratory failure ([Zhou et al,
                Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
            
              - 2. Among non-survivors, a steady rise in troponin I
                levels was  
                observed throughout the disease course from day 4 of
                illness through day 22 ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
    5.  **Mechanism:**
        1.    - The mechanism is unknown, though several have been
                proposed,  
                based on very limited data outside of case series and
                reports ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452); [Hu
                et al, Eur Heart J,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300);
                [Zeng et al, Preprints,
                2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1))
            
              - a. Possible direct toxicity through viral invasion into
                cardiac  
                myocytes (*i.e.*, myocarditis)
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Acute coronary syndrome and demand ischemia
            
            3.    - Stress or cytokine-mediated cardiomyopathy
                    (*i.e.,*  
                    Takotsubo’s)
2.  **Cardiovascular Testing**
    1.  **Troponin:**
        1.  ICU patients: Check hsTrop daily and SCvO2 daily
        2.  Inpatients: Check hsTrop every other day
            1.  If hsTrop > 200 ng/L
                1.  Obtain 12-lead ECG
                
                2.    - Perform point-of-care US (POCUS) if you are
                        trained to  
                        do so
                
                3.    - If no new ECG or echocardiographic
                        abnormalities,  
                        continue to monitor every other day hsTrop
    2.  **Telemetry:**
        1.  Telemetry should be used for all critically-ill patients
        
        2.  At BWH, COVID-19 floor patients also have telemetry.
        
        3.    - For hospitals, with resource-limitations, telemetry is
                most  
                important for patients who meet AHA criteria ([Sandau et
                al, Circulation,
                2017](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28974521)).
    3.  **ECGs:**
        1.  Daily ECGs are reasonable for individuals with severe
            COVID-19.
            1.    - When possible, print ECGs from the in-room monitor
                    to  
                    minimize contamination of equipment.
    4.  **TTE:**
        1.  Do not order routine TTEs on COVID-19 patients.
            
            1.    - Cardiology consult or a trained provider should
                    perform  
                    POCUS if:
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  Significant troponin elevation or decline in
                    ScvO2/MvO2
                2.  Shock
                3.  New heart failure (not pre-existing heart failure)
                4.  New persistent arrhythmia
                5.  Significant ECG changes
        
        2.    - If abnormalities are identified on POCUS (e.g. new
                reduction  
                in LVEF < 50%), a formal TTE should be obtained and
                cardiology consulted.
            
              - 1. Where possible order limited TTEs instead of full
                TTEs to  
                conserve resources.
    5.  **Stress Testing:**
        1.    - Stress testing is likely not indicated in individuals
                with  
                active COVID.
        
        2.    - Any question of possible stress testing should be
                directed to  
                cardiology.
3.  **Arrhythmias**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Case series report the occurrence of unspecified
                arrhythmias  
                in 17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=23 of
                138), with higher rate in ICU patients (44%, n=16)
                compared to non-ICU patients (7%, n=7) ([Wang et al,
                JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570)).
        
        2.    - There are anecdotal reports of VT and VF as a late  
                manifestation of COVID-19. No specific published
                findings were identified.
    2.  **Workup:**
        1.  Telemetry, 12-lead EKG, cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, TFT
        2.  ScvO2 if central line present (goal SCVO2 > 60%)
        3.  POCUS to assess LV and RV function
            1.  Obtain formal TTE if abnormalities of any of the above
    3.  **Treatment:**
        1.  Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter
            1.  Beta blockade if no evidence of heart failure or shock
                1.    - If significant heart failure or borderline BPs,
                        use  
                        amiodarone. There is no known increased concern
                        for amiodarone lung toxicity
            2.  If unstable, synchronized DCCV with 200 Joules biphasic
        2.  Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
            1.  Unstable/pulseless: initiate ACLS
            2.  Stable:
                1.    - Cardiology consult (may represent evolving
                        myocardial  
                        involvement)
                
                2.  Amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 or lidocaine 100mg IV x 1
4.  **Acute Coronary Syndromes**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - There is no current available data on the incidence of
                ACS in  
                COVID. However, we presume that due to the presence of
                ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and the known
                increased risk of ACS in influenza that there is a
                possible increased incidence of ACS among COVID-19
                patients.
            
              - 1. The incidence of ACS is about 6 times as high within
                seven  
                days of an influenza diagnosis than during control
                interval - incidence ratio 6.05 (95% CI, 3.86 to 9.50)
                ([Kwong et al, NEJM,
                2018](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365305)).
    2.  **Workup:**
        1.    - Elevated troponin/ECG changes alone may not be able to  
                discriminate between:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Coronary thrombosis
            2.  Demand-related ischemia
            3.  Myocarditis
        
        2.  Determination of ACS will rely on all evidence available:
            
            1.  Symptoms (if able to communicate)
                
                1.  New dyspnea, chest pain, anginal equivalents
            
            2.  Regional ECG changes
            
            3.    - Rate of change of Troponin changes (*i.e.*, acute
                    rise  
                    suggests ACS)
            
            4.  Echo findings (*e.g.*, new RWMA)
        
        3.  When in doubt, request a cardiology consult.
    3.  **Management:**
        1.    - Medical management of ACS should be coordinated with  
                cardiology
            
              - 1. Treat with full dose aspirin, clopidogrel (if not  
                bleeding), heparin, oxygen (if hypoxemic), statin,
                nitrates (if hypertensive), and opioids (if persistent
                pain during medical management).
                
                1.  Beta blockers should be used with caution given
                    possible concomitant myocarditis/decompensated heart
                    failure.
        
        2.    - As of the time of this writing, the cath lab will take  
                COVID-19 patients, even if ventilated.
            
              - 1. If resources become constrained and door-to-balloon
                time is  
                no longer adequate, cardiology may decide to use lytic
                medications for COVID-19 STEMI patients in lieu of PCI.
5.  **Pericarditis and Myocarditis**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Myocarditis and pericarditis are potential
                manifestations of  
                COVID-19 and source of Acute Cardiac Injury, based on
                case reports/case series ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care
                Med, 2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
                [Zeng et al, Preprints,
                2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1);
                [Hu et al, Eur Heart J,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300))
        
        2.    - However, there is currently no evidence of proven
                pericarditis  
                or myocarditis, either by biopsy or cMRI.
    2.  **Diagnosis:**
        1.  Likely no role for endomyocardial biopsy
        
        2.    - cMRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with
                a  
                cardiology consult team.
    3.  **Management:**
        1.  Supportive for heart failure and direct viral treatments
        
        2.    - The use of anti-inflammatory medications such as
                Colchicine  
                and Ibuprofen should also be discussed with the
                cardiology consult team as this literature is evolving.

# Chapter 5: Shock: Septic, Cardiogenic, and Cytokine Storm

1.  **Undifferentiated Shock in COVID**
    1.  **Definition:**
        1.    - Acute onset of new and sustained hypotension (MAP < 65
                or SBP <  
                90) with signs of hypoperfusion requiring IVF or
                vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure
    2.  **Time course:**
        1.  Patients rarely present in shock on admission
            1.    - Natural history seems to favor the development of
                    shock  
                    after multiple days of critical illness.
    3.  **Etiology:**
        1.    - The range of reasons for shock is wide and more variable
                than  
                for most patients and includes:
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Cardiogenic shock
            2.  Secondary bacterial infection
            3.  Cytokine storm
    4.  **Workup for new undifferentiated shock:**
        1.  Assess for severity of end organ damage:
            
            1.    - UOP, Mental status, Lactate, BUN/creatinine,
                    electrolytes,  
                    LFTs
        
        2.    - Obtain a FULL infectious workup, which includes all of
                the  
                following:
            
              - 1. Labs: CBC with differential. Note that most COVID
                patients  
                are lymphopenic (83%). However, new leukocytosis can
                occur and left-shift can be used as a part of clinical
                picture ([Guan et al, N Engl J Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109013)). Two
                sets of blood cultures, LFTs (for cholangitis/acalculous
                cholecystitis), urinalysis (with reflex to culture),
                sputum culture (if safely obtained via inline
                suctioning, do not perform bronchoscopy or sputum
                induction), procalcitonin at 0 and 48h (do not withhold
                early antibiotics on the basis of procalcitonin*),*
                urine Strep and legionella antigens
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Portable CXR (avoid CT unless absolutely necessary)
            3.  Full skin exam
        
        3.  Assess for cardiogenic shock
            
            1.  Assess extremities: warm or cool on exam
            
            2.  Assess patient volume status: JVP, CVP, edema, CXR
            
            3.    - Assess pulse pressure: If < 25% of the SBP,
                    correlates  
                    highly with a reduction in cardiac index to less
                    than 2.2 with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity
                    of 83% ([Stevenson and Perloff, JAMA,
                    1989](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913385))
            
            4.  Perform POCUS if trained to do so
                
                1.  For TTE protocols see [“Cardiac Complications of
                    COVID-19”
                    chapter](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).
            
            5.    - Labs: Obtain an SCV02 or MV02 if the patient has
                    central  
                    access, troponin x2, NT proBNP, A1c, lipid profile,
                    TSH
            
            6.  EKG (and telemetry)
            
            7.  Calculate estimated Fick Cardiac Output
                
                1.    - CO (Cardiac Output), L/min = VO<sub>2</sub>/  
                        [(SaO<sub>2</sub> - SvO<sub>2</sub>) x Hb x
                        13.4)],
                    
                      - i. where VO<sub>2</sub> = 125 mL
                        O<sub>2</sub>/min x BSA,  
                        where BSA = [(Height, cm x Weight, kg)/ 3,600
                        ]<sup>½</sup>; in patients aged ≥70, use 110 mL
                        O<sub>2</sub> x BSA for VO<sub>2</sub>
                
                2.    - MDcalc online calculators: [Fick
                        CO](http://www.mdcalc.com/cardiac-output-ficks-formula),  
                        [BSA](http://www.mdcalc.com/body-mass-index-bmi-body-surface-area-bsa)
        
        4.  Assess for other causes of shock:
            
            1.  Vasoplegia:
                
                1.    - Run medication list for recent
                        cardiosuppressive  
                        medications, vasodilatory agents,
                        antihypertensives
            
            2.  Adrenal insufficiency:
                
                1.    - Unless high pretest probability of adrenal  
                        insufficiency, we recommend against routine
                        cortisone stimulation testing
            
            3.  Obstruction:
                
                1.  PE (given the elevated risk of thrombosis)
                2.  Tamponade (given elevated risk of pericarditis)
                3.  Obstruction from PEEP
            
            4.    - Cytokine storm (see [“Cytokine Activation Syndrome”
                    section](#cytokine-activation-syndrome) in this  
                    chapter below)
            
            5.  Allergic reactions to recent medications
            
            6.  Neurogenic shock is uncommon in this context
            
            7.  Hypovolemia:
                
                1.  Bleeding
                2.  Insensible losses from fever
                3.  Diarrhea/vomiting

3.  **Septic Shock and Secondary Infections**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - The reported rates of sepsis and septic shock are not
                reported  
                consistently in currently available case series
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Secondary bacterial infections are reported:
                1.  20% of non-survivors ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076))
                2.  16% of non-survivors ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care
                    Med,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))
                3.  12-19% In H1N1 epidemic ([MacIntyre et al, BMC
                    Infect Dis,
                    2018](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526505))
        
        2.    - Concurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in
                at  
                least one case (possibly due to lymphopenia)
    2.  **Antibiosis:**
        1.    - Early empiric antibiotics should be initiated within 1
                hour  
                (see [“Antibiotic Stewardship”
                section](#antibiotic-stewardship) within [“COVID-19
                Therapies and Clinical Trials”
                chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials))
    3.  **Conservative Fluid Management:**
        1.  Goal MAP > 65mmHg
        
        2.    - Start Norepinephrine while determining the etiology of  
                undifferentiated shock
        
        3.  We do not recommend conventional 30cc/kg resuscitation
            
            1.  Give 250-500cc IVF and assess in 15-30 minutes for:
                
                1.  Increase > 2 in CVP
                2.  Increase in MAP or decrease in pressor requirement
                    1.    - Use isotonic crystalloids; Lactated
                            Ringer’s  
                            solution is preferred where possible. Avoid
                            hypotonic fluids, starches, or colloids
            
            2.    - Repeat 250-500cc IVF boluses; Use dynamic measures
                    of  
                    fluid responsiveness
                
                  - a. Pulse Pressure Variation: can be calculated in  
                    mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmia;
                    PPV >12% is sensitive and specific for volume
                    responsiveness
                
                  - b. Straight Leg Raise: raise legs to 45° w/ supine
                    torso  
                    for at least one minute. A change in pulse pressure
                    of > 12% has sensitivity of 60% & specificity of
                    85% for fluid responsiveness in mechanically
                    ventilated patients; less accurate if spontaneously
                    breathing
                
                  - c. Ultrasound evaluation of IVC collapsibility
                    should only  
                    be undertaken by trained personnel to avoid
                    contamination of ultrasound
            
            3.    - For further guidance, Conservative Fluid
                    Management  
                    protocols are available from from FACCT Lite trial
                    ([Grissom et al, Crit Care Med,
                    2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463)).
            
            4.    - *Rationale*: COVID-19 clinical reports indicate
                    the  
                    majority of patients present with respiratory
                    failure without shock. ARDS is mediated in part by
                    pulmonary capillary leak, and randomized controlled
                    trials of ARDS indicate that a conservative fluid
                    strategy is protective in this setting ([Grissom et
                    al, Crit Care Med,
                    2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463);
                    [Famous et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med,
                    2017](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27513822);
                    [Silversides et al, Int Care Med,
                    2017](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734109);
                    [WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance, March
                    2020](http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected)).
    4.  **Pressor management**
        1.    - Unless new evidence emerges, standard choices for
                distributive  
                shock (*i.e.*, norepinephrine then vasopressin) are
                recommended, with high vigilance for the development of
                cardiogenic shock, addressed in the next section.
    5.  **Corticosteroids**
        1.  See [“Systemic Corticosteroids”
            section](#systemic-corticosteroids) within [“COVID-19
            Therapies and Clinical Trials”
            chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials).
            1.    - Stress dose hydrocortisone should still be
                    considered in  
                    patients on > 2 pressors*.*
4.  **Cardiogenic Shock**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Heart failure or cardiogenic shock was observed in 23%
                (n=44  
                of 191) of hospitalized patients in one case series
                ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
                Moreover, there were higher rates in non-survivors (52%,
                n=28) compared to survivors (12%, n=16). Among 21
                patients admitted to an ICU in Washington State 33%
                (n=7) developed a new cardiomyopathy ([Arentz et al,
                JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191259)).
                Notably, these patients tended to be older with more
                comorbidities and had a high mortality (11 of the 21
                died).
        
        2.    - Heart failure or myocardial damage contributed to death
                in 39%  
                (n=29) of deaths in a series of 68 patients in Wuhan.
                Most (n=22 of 29) had concomitant respiratory failure
                ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452)).
    2.  **Diagnosis:**
        1.    - Significant concern for cardiogenic shock if any of
                the  
                following are present with evidence of hypoperfusion
                (*e.g.*, elevated lactate):
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Elevated NT-proBNP, or
            2.  CvO2 < 60% (PvO2 < 35 mm Hg), or
            3.  Echocardiogram with depressed LV and/or RV function
    3.  **Time course:**
        1.    - Cardiogenic shock may present late in the course of
                illness  
                even after improvement of respiratory symptoms, and
                manifest as a precipitous clinical deterioration in the
                setting of an acute decline in LVEF (see [“Acute Cardiac
                Injury” section](#acute-cardiac-injury) in [“Cardiac
                Complications”
                chapter](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19)).
    4.  **Etiology:**
        1.    - See [“Acute Cardiac Injury”
                section](#acute-cardiac-injury)  
                in [“Cardiac Complications”
                chapter](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).
        
        2.    - Mechanism is unknown, potentially direct viral toxicity,
                ACS,  
                or stress cardiomyopathy.
    5.  **Workup:**
        1.    - Rule out ACS and complete the initial work up as
                described in  
                [“Cardiac Complications”
                chapter](#chapter-4-cardiac-complications-of-covid-19).
        
        2.  Ongoing monitoring:
            
            1.    - Labs: Trend troponins to peak, SCvO2 (obtained by
                    upper  
                    body CVC) or MvO2 q8-12h or with clinical change,
                    Lactate q4-6h, LFTs daily (for hepatic congestion)
            
            2.  Daily EKGs or prn with clinical deterioration
            
            3.  Trend troponin to peak
        
        3.  All cardiogenic shock cases require cardiovascular consult
            
            1.    - PA catheters may be placed bedside by experienced  
                    providers, with preference for use only in mixed
                    shock or complex cases with cardiology guidance
    6.  **Medical management:**
        1.    - Close collaboration with the cardiovascular
                consultation  
                service is recommended
        
        2.    - Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25,
                SVR  
                800-1000, SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2
            
              - 1. Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then
                optimize  
                other parameters
        
        3.  How to achieve goals:
            
            1.    - Continue titration of norepinephrine gtt for goal
                    MAP  
                    65-75
            
            2.  Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD
                > 25
            
            3.  Initiate inotropic support:
                
                1.    - Dobutamine gtt for SCvO2 < 60%, CI < 2.2 and
                        MAP > 65.  
                        Start at 2mcg/kg/min. Up-titrate by
                        1-2mcg/kg/min every 30-60 minutes for goal
                        parameters. Alternative strategies should be
                        considered once dose exceeds 5mcg/kg/min.
                        Maximum dose is 10mcg/kg/min.
            
            4.    - Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers,
                    calcium  
                    channel blockers and antihypertensives are
                    discontinued.
    7.  **Candidacy for Mechanical Support**
        1.    - The benefit of Mechanical Support in COVID-19 is not
                yet  
                clear. In one study of patients with severe COVID-19,
                five (83%) of six patients receiving ECMO died ([Yang et
                al, Lancet Respir Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632)).
                There is concern that the further decrease of
                lymphocytes from ECMO could contribute to higher
                mortality. However, this is a very small study and more
                information is needed.
        
        2.    - Patients who experience the following should prompt an  
                immediate call to the cardiovascular medicine consult
                service for consideration of mechanical support:
            
              - 1. Dobutamine gtt at 5mcg/kg/min (or unable to
                tolerate  
                dobutamine due to tachyarrhythmias) and SCVO2 < 60% or
                CI < 2.2
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Lactate > 4 after medical therapy
        
        3.    - The criteria for ECMO and other mechanical
                cardiovascular  
                support varies among centers and are difficult to
                develop under typical circumstances. The unclear
                trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic makes these
                evaluations even more difficult. Please refer to the
                separate BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular Medicine guidelines
                which are in development.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Younger age

2.  Expected life expectancy >6 months pre-hospitalization

3.  No evidence of solid or liquid malignancy

4.  Able to tolerate anticoagulation

5.  Platelets >50,000

6.  Absence of severe peripheral arterial disease

7.  No evidence of irreversible neurological injury

8.  Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

9.    - Cannot have profound respiratory failure (defined as requiring
        prone  
        ventilation at time of consult for MCS or having PaO2:FiO2 ratio
        <
        150) (for MCS other than ECMO)

10. **Cytokine Activation Syndrome**
    
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have
                cytokine  
                storm syndrome and secondary HLH ([Mehta et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192578)).
                Patients who had cytokine storm developed rapid
                progression to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure
                ([Chen et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143))
    2.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - Neutrophil activation likely contributes to the
                pathogenesis  
                of cytokine storm and ARDS ([Wu et al, JAMA Intern Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)). [Wu
                et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)
                found that COVID-19 confirmed patients with ARDS have
                higher neutrophil counts, average 7.04 (95% CI: 3.98 to
                10.12) vs. those without ARDS, average 3.06 (2.03 to
                5.56)
        
        2.    - Similar patterns of cytokine storm and ARDS have been
                seen  
                with SARS, MERS ([Kim et al, J Korean Med Sci,
                2016](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709848))
        
        3.    - Other studies have suggested that increased
                proinflammatory  
                cytokines in the serum are associated with pulmonary
                injury in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 ([Wong et al, Clin
                Exp Immunol,
                2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030519))
    3.  **Workup:**
        1.    - Suspect if clinical deterioration with shock and
                multiorgan  
                failure
        
        2.    - CBC with diff, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer,
                ferritin,  
                liver function test, triglycerides, c-reactive protein
                (CRP) ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452))
            
              - 1. CRP seems to correlate with disease severity and
                prognosis  
                of COVID-19 ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452);
                [Young et al, JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125362))
            
              - 2. An HScore ([MDcalc online
                calculator](http://www.mdcalc.com/hscore-reactive-hemophagocytic-syndrome))  
                may be helpful in estimating the probability of
                secondary HLH in these patients
    4.  **Management:**
        1.    - If high suspicion, discuss with ID about the use of
                IVIG,  
                steroids, cytokine blockade, particularly IL-6 pathway
                and perhaps IL-1 (see [“Anti-IL6 Agents”
                section](#anti-il6-agents-tocilizumab-siltuximab) within
                [“COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials”
                chapter](#chapter-3-covid-19-therapies-and-clinical-trials)).
                While steroids have been implicated with worse lung
                injury and outcomes, they may be beneficial in the
                hyperinflammatory state.

1.  **Thrombotic Disease**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Unclear incidence, though case reports suggest there may
                be  
                increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19
                patients ([Xie et al, Radiol Cardiothoracic Imaging,
                2020](http://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200067))
    2.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.  The mechanism for VTE are unknown and likely multifactorial:
            
            1.  Systemic inflammatory response as seen in sepsis
            
            2.  Stasis/critical illness
            
            3.    - Possibly direct endothelial damage from viral
                    injury/ACE2  
                    binding
        
        2.    - Colleagues from Wuhan have reported finding microthrombi
                in  
                pulmonary vasculature on autopsy ([Luo et al, Preprints,
                2020
                preprint](http://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0407/v2)),
                which could contribute to local V/Q mismatch or
                hydrostatic changes causing edema. However these
                mechanisms remain entirely hypothetical.
        
        3.    - One theory: SARS-CoV Spike protein can be cleaved by FXa
                and  
                FIIa. Cleavage of the Spike protein activates it which
                promotes infectivity. By extension, it is hypothesized
                that anticoagulation might inhibit SARS-CoV-2
                replication. There is a small case series suggesting
                dipyridamole may be useful, though anticoagulation and
                antiplatelet agents require further investigation prior
                to being used therapeutically ([Liu et al, medRxiv, 2020
                preprint](http://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557)).
    3.  **Management:**
        1.    - Initiate prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for all  
                COVID-19 patients unless otherwise contraindicated
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  If CrCl > 30: Lovenox 40 mg SC daily
            2.  If CrCl < 30 or AKI: Heparin 5000 units SC TID
            3.  Hold if Platelets <30,000 or bleeding, start TEDs and
                SCDs
        
        2.    - If the patient is on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
                or  
                Warfarin for Afib or VTE, switch to full dose
                anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH, as indicated based on
                renal function or clinical scenario).
        
        3.    - While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used
                empirically  
                in some severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan given the
                microthrombi in pulmonary vasculature (see
                “Pathophysiology” above), our interpretation of the
                data is that the risks outweigh the benefits at this
                time, unless documented DVT or PE.
    4.  **Prognosis:**
        1.    - Higher D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ  
                dysfunction syndrome and poorer prognosis ([Wang et al,
                JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570);
                [Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
2.  **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**
    1.  **Incidence/pathophysiology:**
        1.    - Limited data: 16 of 183 hospitalized patients in Wuhan
                had DIC  
                ([Tang et al, J Thromb Haemost,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).
        
        2.    - Laboratory changes in coagulation parameters and FDP
                track  
                with multi-organ dysfunction ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
    2.  **Time course:**
        1.    - Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into hospital
                admission  
                ([Tang et al, J Thromb Haemost,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).
    3.  **Workup:**
        1.  Identify and treat underlying condition
        2.  ISTH DIC score ([MDcalc online
            calculator](http://www.mdcalc.com/isth-criteria-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic))
            1.  If score < 5, no DIC; recalculate in 1-2 days
    4.  **Management:**
        1.  If bleeding, give blood products:
            1.    - For elevated PT/PTT and bleeding, use FFP or
                    4F-PCC  
                    (KCentra is less volume, but must discuss dose with
                    HAT/pharmacy)
        2.  If not bleeding, supportive care:
            1.    - If fibrinogen < 150: FFP, cryoprecipitate or
                    fibrinogen  
                    concentrate (RiaSTAP or Fibryga)
                
                  - a. RiaSTAP and Fibryga are less volume, but dose
                    must be  
                    discussed with HAT/pharmacy
            
            2.  Transfuse platelets if < 30K
        3.  Hold anticoagulation for active bleeding.
            1.    - Consider holding anticoagulation if patient requires
                    blood  
                    products for supportive care, though clinician
                    should weigh risks and benefits.
        4.  Start anticoagulation only if:
            1.    - Overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot  
                    (*i.e.*, purpura fulminans)
            
            2.    - There has been no mortality benefit of therapeutic  
                    anticoagulation in DIC ([Levi et al, Blood,
                    2018](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29255070)).
    5.  **Prognosis:**
        1.    - DIC is associated with worse survival in COVID-19
                patients. Out  
                of 183 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 71% of non-survivors
                had DIC (ISTH score ≥ 5; [MDcalc online
                calculator](http://www.mdcalc.com/isth-criteria-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic))
                compared to 0.6% of survivors ([Tang et al, J Thromb
                Haemost,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213)).

# Chapter 7: Renal Manifestations

1.  **Acute Kidney Injury**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies widely, but
                estimates range  
                from 2.1% to 29%.
    2.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.    - Likely that the most common pathophysiology will be
                acute  
                tubular necrosis (ATN) driven by shock ([Xianghong et
                al, Natl Med J China,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145717)) and
                in some cases cytokine storm.
            
              - 1. Areas for future research: Some have hypothesized
                that there  
                could direct cellular injury by the virus via
                angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). COVID-19 uses
                ACE2 for cell entry. ACE2 is expressed in proximal renal
                tubules more than glomeruli ([Fan et al, medRxiv,
                2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418));
                but it remains likely that shock (and in some cases
                cytokine storm) are the main causes of ATN.
    3.  **Workup:**
        1.  Monitor Creatinine at least daily
            1.    - Studies find variable onset of AKI, from 7 days
                    ([Cheng et al, medRxiv, 2020
                    preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))  
                    to 15 days after illness onset ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                    2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
                    Onset of AKI more rapid and severe in patients with
                    underlying CKD ([Cheng et al, medRxiv, 2020
                    preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))
        2.  If evidence of rising BUN and/or creatinine, order
            urinalysis
            1.    - Patients may present with proteinuria (44%),
                    hematuria  
                    (26.9%)
    4.  **Management:**
        1.    - Consult ICU nephrology early at the first sign of renal
                injury  
                for all COVID-19 confirmed patients
            
              - 1. Do not wait until need for RRT (renal replacement  
                therapy)/dialysis for consultation.
            
              - 2. At this time, all confirmed COVID-19 patients should
                be  
                covered by ICU nephrology, not general nephrology
                
                1.  ICU
                2.  RRT Triage
                3.  Floor
        
        2.  Managing AKI:
            
            1.  Minimize nephrotoxic agents
            
            2.    - Give judicious fluids for suspected prerenal
                    insults, but  
                    discuss with renal if any ambiguity (see [“Shock”
                    chapter](#chapter-5-shock-septic-cardiogenic-and-cytokine-storm)
                    for conservative fluid recommendations)
    5.  **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT):**
        1.    - Estimates for RRT range from 1 to 5% of hospitalized  
                patients. Among critically ill patients, need for CRRT
                ranges from 5 to 23%
            
              - 1. Few studies have reported outcomes of RRT. One case
                series  
                reported that out of 191 patients, 10 received CRRT, and
                all 10 died ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
        
        2.  Renal will be coordinating RRT continuation and initiation
            
            1.    - Indications for dialysis in COVID-19 patients are
                    the same  
                    as the indications for all patients.
        
        3.    - ICU nephrology will determine the need, timing, and
                modality  
                of renal replacement on a case-by-case basis.
    6.  **Prognosis:**
        1.    - Increased serum creatine, BUN, AKI, proteinuria, or
                hematuria  
                are each independent risk factors for in-hospital death
                ([Cheng et al, medRxiv, 2020
                preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242))
        
        2.    - In two other studies, non-survivors had higher BUN and  
                creatinine and higher rates of AKI ([Wang et al, JAMA,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570)*;*
                <span class="title-ref">Yang et al, Lancet Respir Med,
                2020)
                <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632></span>__.
        
        3.    - Another study found that higher BUN and creatinine are  
                associated with progression to ARDS, and higher BUN
                (though not creatinine) is associated with death (HR
                1.06-1.20) ([Wu et al, JAMA Intern Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).
        
        4.    - In comparison, AKI was found in 6.7% of SARS patients.
                AKI  
                correlated with poor prognosis and 91.7% of patients
                with AKI died (vs 8.8% without AKI, p < 0.0001) ([Chu
                et al, Kidney Int,
                2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673319)).

# Chapter 8: Other Guidance

1.  **Liver Disease**
    1.  **Incidence:**
        1.    - Up to 53% of patients had abnormal alanine
                aminotransferase  
                (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ([Zhang et
                al, Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145190)).
    2.  **Pathophysiology:**
        1.  Possible mechanisms of liver injury include:
            1.    - Direct viral infection of liver cells (2-10% of
                    patients  
                    have diarrhea; COVID-19 found in stool samples)
            
            2.  Drug hepatotoxicity
            
            3.  Cytokine storm
            
            4.  Shock
    3.  **Time course:**
        1.    - In general, liver injury in mild COVID-19 disease is
                transient  
                and self-resolving. However, liver injury correlates
                with severity
            
              - 1. ALT > 40 is associated with higher odds of
                in-hospital death  
                ([Zhou et al, Lancet,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076)).
            
              - 2. AST is associated with progression to ARDS but not
                death;  
                total bilirubin is associated with both progression to
                ARDS and death ([Wu et al, JAMA Intern Med,
                2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524)).
    4.  **Monitoring:**
        1.  Monitor LFTs every third day
            
            1.    - If on hepatotoxic medications, monitor more
                    frequently in  
                    conjunction with pharmacy.
            
            2.    - If starting Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Chloroquine,
                    monitor  
                    LFTs daily.
        
        2.    - Workup for other etiologies of liver injury with
                RUQUS,  
                doppler ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, etc., as
                clinically indicated.
    5.  **Management:**
        1.    - Consult GI/Hepatology if concern for acute liver
                failure  
                (severe liver injury with elevated bilirubin,
                encephalopathy, and INR >1.5).
        
        2.    - Run medication list for all possible offending agents
                and  
                discontinue where possible.
        
        3.    - N-Acetyl-Cysteine is not recommended at this time due
                to  
                significant volume load. Chinese studies refer to giving
                “liver protective drugs” in case of severe liver injury
                but we recommend against this for now.
        
        4.    - There are no current guidelines for treatment of
                COVID-19  
                patients with underlying cirrhosis, but societies such
                as AASLD are working on registries of these patients.
2.  **Considerations for Oncology Patients**
    1.  **Data:**
        1.    - As of March 16, 2020, there are no available published
                data  
                specific to COVID-19 management in oncologic or
                immunosuppressed patients.
    2.  **Oncology Consultation/Coverage:**
        1.    - For established DFCI patients, oncology consultation
                and  
                guidance is provided by each patient’s primary
                oncologist (or coverage).
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  Contact primary oncologist via page, not the general
                pager.
    3.  **Prognosis:**
        1.    - Many patients have reasonable or even good prognosis
                with  
                current therapies. Do not assume a prognosis, involve
                outpatient attending.
    4.  **Meds:**
        1.  Check in Epic medications tab and in “Research: Active” tab.
    5.  **Workup:**
        1.  Labs:
            1.    - Weekly glucan/galactomannan in
                    neutropenic/transplant  
                    patients.
            
            2.    - Specific patient populations may require
                    additional  
                    monitoring (such as CMV, EBV monitoring in
                    transplant patients – ask outpatient team).
        2.  Exam:
            1.  Examine catheters (port, CVC, others) daily.
            
            2.    - Avoid rectal exams in neutropenic patients, but
                    examine the  
                    perirectal area if symptoms or persistent fevers.
            
            3.  Do not give per rectum therapies to neutropenic
                patients.
    6.  **Pain management:**
        1.    - Patients with cancer-related pain may have high opiate
                needs at  
                baseline. Opiates should not be stopped but type may
                need to be adjusted in the setting of respiratory
                failure, renal injury, or liver injury.
            
              - 1. Pain / Palliative Care service can help guide dose  
                titrations in these situations.
    7.  **Goals of Care:**
        1.    - Involve primary team whenever possible (recognizing that
                in  
                critical/emergent situations may not be possible).
    8.  **Anticoagulation:**
        1.    - Thrombosis prophylaxis should be initiated for all
                patients  
                unless otherwise contraindicated, given that both
                COVID-19 infection and malignancy increase thrombotic
                risk, particularly with solid tumors.
            
              - 1. See [“Thrombotic Disease”
                section](#thrombotic-disease)  
                within [“Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations”
                chapter](#chapter-6-thrombotic-and-coagulation-manifestations)
                for guidelines on both prophylactic and therapeutic
                anticoagulation.
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            2.  Remember to hold if platelet count < 30K.
    9.  **Patients with Heme Malignancy and Stem Cell Transplant:**
        1.    - Daily exam: Findings are more subtle or absent in
                neutropenic  
                and immune suppressed patients. Examine catheters daily.
                Avoid rectal exam.
    10. **Febrile Neutropenia:**
        1.  Definition:
            1.  ANC < 500 cells/mm3 AND T ≥ 101F or T ≥ 100.5 for 1hr
        2.  Workup:
            1.    - Blood cultures from peripheral (ideally two sets),
                    and  
                    each lumen of central line (label clearly); UA/sed
                    with urine culture (UA may not be as informative
                    with neutropenia); glucan and galactomannan (if not
                    checked recently), sputum if able; CXR
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  Continue DAILY blood cultures while febrile.
                
                2.    - Monitor serum galactomannan and 1-3-beta glucan
                        once  
                        weekly.
                
                3.    - Any positive glucan or galactomannan prompts
                        ID  
                        consult.
        3.  Initial Empiric Antibiotics:
            1.  GNRs: Ceftazidime OR Cefepime
                
                1.    - Alternatives: Piperacillin-tazobactam (2nd line)
                        or  
                        meropenem (3rd line).
            
            2.    - GPCs: add Vancomycin if hemodynamically unstable, or
                    if  
                    MRSA pneumonia or catheter-associated infection is
                    suspected. Check dosing with pharmacy if able.
        4.  Removal of lines:
            1.    - Catheter removal should be discussed if associated  
                    infection is suspected - involve primary oncologist
                    and/or ID team to weigh risks and benefits, given
                    that not all lines require removal.
        5.  Persistent Neutropenic Fever:
            1.  If fever persists x3 days despite antibiotics
                1.  Micafungin 100mg IV daily
                
                2.    - Consideration of further imaging even if
                        patient  
                        appears stable (discuss with oncology / ID).
        6.  Antiinfective course:
            1.    - Anti-Infectives should be continued until the
                    patient has  
                    met all of these criteria:
                
                <!-- end list -->
                
                1.  clinically improved, and
                2.  has been afebrile for 48h, and
                3.  has been non-neutropenic for 48h.
    11. **Transfusions:**
        1.    - Blood bank reviews orders and will release appropriate
                products  
                (*i.e.*, irradiated, leukoreduced, etc).
            
            <!-- end list -->
            
            1.  RBC transfusion if Hgb < 7 or Hct < 21.
            
            2.    - Platelet transfusion if Platelets < 10K. Higher
                    transfusion  
                    goals if needed for procedures or if active
                    bleeding:
                
                  - a. Platelet count > 20K if mild bleeding (*i.e.*,
                    epistaxis,  
                    line oozing) or if patient has rigors.
                
                  - b. Platelet count > 50K if more serious bleeding;
                    may be  
                    higher for CNS bleeding or neurosurgery required.
            
            3.  Cryoprecipitate transfusion if fibrinogen < 100.
            
            4.  FFP transfusion if procedure needed (INR of FFP =
                ~1.4).
    12. **Patients with Solid Tumors:**
        1.    - Patients with solid tumors are at very high risk of  
                thrombosis but at lower risk of infection than most heme
                malignancy patients.
        
        2.    - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) do not
                significantly  
                immune suppress patients when used alone.
            
              - 1. Most common are CTLA-4 inhibitor (ipilimumab) and  
                PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab,
                durvalumab, atezolizumab and avelumab).
        
        3.  Immune toxicity:
            
            1.    - If patient develops organ dysfunction, it may be due
                    to  
                    immune toxicity- consult the service team of the
                    involved organ system and inform primary oncologist.
            
            2.    - Common immune toxicities include pneumonitis /
                    respiratory  
                    failure (may be difficult to distinguish between
                    COVID19 disease or may be aggravated by COVID19
                    infection), colitis, endocrine dysfunction (thyroid,
                    pituitary / hypothalamic, adrenal), nephritis. Less
                    common hepatitis, meningitis, dermatitis.
                
                  - a. Check TSH, ACTH, cortisol, T-spot, HIV, HBV,
                    HCV  
                    serologies if concerned.
            
            3.    - Immune toxicities are usually treated with high
                    dose  
                    steroids - risks and benefits must be weighed
                    immediately with primary oncologist and ID consult
                    teams if immune toxicity is suspected concurrent
                    with COVID19 infection.
            
            4.    - BWH/DFCI iTox guidelines can be found  
                    [here](http://dfcionline.org/clinical/clinicalresources/immunotherapy-toxicity/)
                    on BWH/DFCI intranet.
3.  **Goals of Care**
    1.  **Assess understanding and sign Health Care Proxy form on
        admission:**
        1.  In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy
            form.
        
        2.    - Make sure families are aware that patients with
                significant  
                comorbid illnesses or who have poor baseline functional
                or health status decompensate rapidly and have very high
                mortality due to COVID-19 (see [“Non-ICU Management,
                Triage, Transfers”
                chapter](#chapter-1-non-icu-management-triage-transfers)).
    2.  **Goals of Care should be documented and focus on:**
        1.  A patient’s desired quality of life
        2.  Tolerance for/desire for invasive measures
        3.  Understanding of disease process
4.  **Management of Cardiac Arrest**
    1.  **Early goals of care conversations are imperative.**
        1.    - The aim is to avoid unnecessary codes in patients
                without a  
                reversible underlying condition.
    2.  **Health care workers should be protected in code situations:**
        1.    - PPE should be worn by all healthcare workers, even if
                donning  
                prolongs time the patient spends in a low-flow state
                during cardiac arrest.
        
        2.    - Codes should be run with an automated compression device
                where  
                available and minimal personnel.
    3.  **Full code guidelines are forthcoming and will be included here
        when available.**
5.  **The Role of Palliative Care**
    1.  This section in in progress
6.  **Ethical Considerations and Resource Allocation**
    1.  This section is in progress

**Afterword**

We built the first iteration of these guidelines “from the bottom up” in
less than a week with the input of over 50 people. With the help of our
readers, we expect to correct and revise as we as a society learn about
COVID-19.

We hope that this pandemic brings with it a new era of collaborativity
and speed in Evidence Based Medicine. We welcome all help, and will be
restructuring this to be more navigable and collaborative in the coming
days.

Currently we are looking for ongoing section editors, please email
<BWHCOVIDGuidelines@gmail.com> if you are interested.

# ADDENDUM: COVID ICU Bundle Checklist

Rationale: Use of a daily checklist ensures that routine quality
measures are in place for each patient. Review Bundle Checklist at the
end of each patient’s presentation, every day. Each section should be
performed unless there is a contraindication or barrier to
implementation. If a contraindication is present, discuss how barriers
may be overcome.

**Ventilator**

🗆 Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)

= turn off sedation

🗆 Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)

= Place patient on Pressure Support 5/5

  - Perform SAT & SBT concurrently if able

- Contraindications to SAT/SBT include FiO2 > 50%, PEEP > 8, O2 sat
< 90%, pH < 7.30, SBP < 90 or MAP < 60, paralysis, intracranial
pressure >15, concern for significant bleeding

🗆 If ARDS: goal Vt 4-6 cc/kg of ideal body weight (calculated by
height), plateau pressure < 30

🗆 Head of bed at >30 degrees

🗆 Oral care is ordered

**Sedation / Delirium**

🗆 Ask: Is patient delirious (CAM+)?

🗆 Review med list for any deliriogenic medications and
discontinue/change where possible

🗆 Define RASS goal

🗆 Record QTc daily, consider changing medications if QTc > 500

**Restraints**

🗆 Ask: Are restraints needed?

🗆 Sign necessary restraint orders

🗆 Discuss barriers to removing restraint orders

**Mobility**

🗆 Consult PT for early mobility

  - Contraindications include: deep sedation, paralysis

**Pressure Ulcers**

🗆 Ask: Are pressure ulcers present? Is a wound care consult needed?

🗆 Discuss whether any changes are needed to ulcer management plan

**DVT prophylaxis**

🗆 Review patient’s current DVT prophylaxis orders and adjust if needed

- Contraindications to LMWH DVT ppx include AKI (switch to UFH TID),
clinically significant bleeding (hold pharmacologic), platelet count <
30K (hold pharmacologic)

  - Add sequential compression boots if holding pharmacologic
    prophylaxis

**GI / Nutrition**

🗆 Famotidine 20mg IV BID in intubated patients; Pantoprazole 20-40mg IV
daily if history of GERD or GI bleed

🗆 Review nutrition, consult nutrition if not already done. While
awaiting nutrition input, start enteral nutrition:

- In most patients, Osmolite 1.5 @10mL/hr, advance by 20mL Q6h to goal
50mL/hr

- If renal failure and high K or phos: Nepro @ 10mL/hr, advance by 10mL
Q6h to goal 40mL/hr

  - MVI with minerals daily
  - thiamine 100mg daily x3 days
  - folate 1mg daily x 3 days

🗆 Ask: Is bowel regimen adequate? Make changes if necessary.

🗆 Review glucose range over past 48h and insulin regimen, adjust regimen
if needed.

  - Goal glucose range is 70-180

**Tubes / Lines / Drains**

🗆 List all tubes / lines / drains and discuss if any can be removed or
should be changed

**Patient / Family Communication**

🗆 Discuss if patient has healthcare making capacity - if not, activate
healthcare proxy

🗆 Update families by phone

  - Suggest RN update at least daily

- MD update Q3 days, with any significant clinical change, or per
family request

**Disposition**

🗆 Discuss anticipated dispo, barriers to dispo

**Code Status**

🗆 Review current code status, discuss if goals of care are realistic
with prognosis - if not, discuss with patient / family

Abbreviations:

SAT = Spontaneous Awakening Trial

SBT = Spontaneous Breathing Trial

CAM = Confusion Assessment Method

RASS = Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale
