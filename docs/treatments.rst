2. Comment regarding ACE inhibitors/ARBS, NSAIDs 6-8

   a. As previously shown for SARS-CoV, COVID-19 similarly utilizes
      angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for viral
      cell entry

   b. ACE2 expression is up-regulated by these medications

      i.   Theoretical risk of facilitation of viral entry into ACE2
           presenting cells

      ii.  At this time no clinical evidence that taking ACEi, ARB, or
           ibuprofen increase risk of acquiring COVID-19 or increase
           disease severity

      iii. The World Health Organization has retracted it’s advisory to
           avoid ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients (3.18.2020)

   c. **Not enough information to recommend discontinuation of ACEi or
      ARB to mitigate risk of COVID-19**

3. Controversial/investigational Agent not routinely recommended. This
   list is not exhaustive of all agents:
